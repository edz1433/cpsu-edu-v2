Dr. Darilag particularly highlighted on how SAS catered mental health well-being of students, on the support of the Commission in the flexible delivery of SAS services, and how the challenges faced in this period had made SAS practitioners to go beyond their means and extend services to the students as the main clientele, especially to the last, the least and the lost.</p>
