<p>Dr. Escober&rsquo;s talk focused on the best practices of CPSU-Murcia in terms of Organic Agriculture and food security that they also share to their students and the local farmers to help increase their production.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The impact we create to our students as they are taught to grow and produce their own food is truly transformational. Being children of farmers, we help them secure their food, hence, minimizing their absences. This is how we truly create an impact to their lives through our advocacy,&rdquo; Dr. Escober said.</p>
