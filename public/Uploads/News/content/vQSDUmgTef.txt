<p>&ldquo;This webinar is a necessary step as we assist our faculty members in preparing for the new normal. Since CHED has advised SUCs to avoid face-to-face learning for the safety of both the students and their instructors, the modular learning approach as a distance /flexible learning mode will be mostly utilized by the University,&rdquo; Dr. Abello explained during his welcome remarks.</p>
