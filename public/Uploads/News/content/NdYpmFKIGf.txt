<p>College of Teacher Education headed by its dean, Dr. Riza Stephanie A. Alfaras, submits its Bachelor in Early Childhood Education program or BECED for Regional Quality Assurance Team (RQAT) evaluation last November 13, 2020 through Zoom live conferencing.</p>

<p>The purpose of the said evaluation was to ensure that the said program meets certain standards required by the Commission on Higher Education prior to their issuance of the Certificate of Program Compliance or COPC.</p>

<p>The RQAT evaluators were Dr. Ma. Cecilia Alimen and Dr. Ma. Mercedes Monsale, the Education Supervisor for Teacher Education.</p>

<p>Together with Dr. Alfaras were Dr. Fernando D. Abello, Vice-President for Academic Affairs, Dr. Grenny Jungco, Quality Assurance Director and Dr. Denis Bilocura, the BECED Program Coordinator, along with other COTED faculty members who attended during the presentation of and deliberation of the documents and supporting evidences for each of the benchmark statements provided by CHED.</p>

<p>This process is part of the requirements of CPSU as a State University to ensure that quality instruction is given and adequate resources and facilities are made available for students&rsquo; effective learning. Passing this kind of evaluation by CHED is a proof of the commitment of the University to provide prime services to its main clientele, the students.</p>
