<p>The distinguished guest in the said event who is recognized as one of the University&rsquo;s pillars is the first NSCA president, Dr. Marcelino Dechavez, who expressed his commendation for the abundant and huge improvement the institution has achieved through the years. He likewise emphasized on the key words that give the institution its purpose and prestige in the entire province. These are Negros and Agriculture, being the lifeblood of the economy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seeing this institution after several years brings nostalgic feelings. Looking back, NONAS had survived various challenges during its time. It was later converted to NOAC, then NSCA and now to CPSU because of the Lord&rsquo;s blessings. And this endeavor will attract more alumni to visit their beloved alma mater. In closing, how I wish that CPSU will grow into a more successful institution of learning with peace, purity, love, labor and faith,&rdquo; Dr. Dechavez said.</p>

<p>Giving his message of response, CPSU president Dr. Aladino Moraca, stated that with what CPSU has reached today, the achievement is similar to representing the University to other countries. Having the widest reservation area compared with other SUCs, the administration made utmost utilization of its abundant resources by partnering with its settlers while also bringing the name of the government as it provides livelihood to some 3,000 families as they farm the soils of CPSU.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have strengthened agriculture as the institution&rsquo;s flagship course through various projects. Significant among them is the prototype model of the Philippine tractor that we have fabricated in partnership with RU Foundry as a concrete indicator of our goal to support agriculture in the province and the country, as a whole. Aside from that, we have the Engineered Bamboo Technology which is already being recognized by the region. We also have our own Essential Oil production, along with black, red and white rice production, banana and camote flour production, muscovado sugar and coffee, along with many others,&rdquo; Dr. Moraca stated.</p>

<p>He further explained how these projects promoted rural enterprise development. These practices are likewise instilled in its graduates so that they would pursue agri-entrepreneurship and run the country&rsquo;s economy in the future.</p>

He expressed his gratefulness to the institution for the opportunity to serve his alma mater, from his education since high school to college, to being employed in the institution, thus spending more than 40 years of his life in the University.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We launch this in memory of the institution&rsquo;s founders, for the students of today and the future to pay tribute and take pride of their Alma Mater&rsquo;s humble beginnings leading to the milestones it has achieved today and, will achieve in the future,&rdquo; Dr. Perez said.</p>
