<p>For. Dominic L. Billen, EMS Director, stated that the Project BRIDGE aims to strengthen the protection and management of TICATO areas, including the barangays along river banks of Ilog-Hilabangan such as Brgy. Orong and Camansi, since these are areas prone to landslides and flooding.</p>

<p>E2RB Project is a DENR Project implemented in the Ilog-Hilabangan River Basin. Ms. Dolores Nuevas, Sr.Coordinator -IH shared her insights on the significance of a plant species called &quot;Miagos&quot;. In her talk, she stated that Miagos bush was identified in an assessment, as a good river bend, which can be a potential measure to address soil erosion and river bank stabilization. She also added in her statement that, &quot;Many lives were saved because of the Miagos bush&quot;.</p>
