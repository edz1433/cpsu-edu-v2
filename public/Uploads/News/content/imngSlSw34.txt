<p>The IMPDC office annually conducts instruction-based webinars and trainings to capacitate faculty members in the preparation of their instructional learning materials (ILMs). For this year, with their ILMs, such as modules, manuals, etc. for the conduct of modular classes in the blended learning set-up already in place, the aim was to assist them further for their acquisition of ISBN at the National Library of the Philippines.</p>
