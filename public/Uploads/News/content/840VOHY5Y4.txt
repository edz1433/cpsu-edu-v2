<p>VP for Academic Affairs, Dr. Fernando D. Abello welcomed the guests, University personnel and students and thanked everyone for their zeal in participating in the activity, especially to the BJMP team as one of the agencies that cater to different gender orientations, programs, and activities as part of their goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The value of women today is greatly acknowledged by society. Especially with the emergence of laws regarding parity, all of us now, therefore, have equal contribution in our society,&rdquo; Dr. Abello stated.</p>

<p>Jail Warden Divina G. Salazar of Binalbagan District Jail, stated in her talk how the observance of the International Women&#39;s Day started as the result of the organizing activities of women in the early 20th century. She added how women between 1901 and 1911 participated in organizing women&rsquo;s strike on streets for days involving children to plea for equality in their rights. Parity is their cry!</p>

<p>&ldquo;WE stands for Women and Everyone, for when women and everyone are included, aside from promoting Women Empowerment, WE can also make gender equality possible, that is what the provided the theme WE for gender Equality,&rdquo; JINSP Salazar said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They had what they aimed for; to inform and engage, to provide platforms in order to address gaps, to inspire women and girls to empower themselves in taking leadership roles, and to promote a society that ensures inclusion. Let us embrace equity because women are not women for nothing. They have minds, decisions, principles, and are made for greater things. Hence, in this world full of &quot;you are just a woman&quot;, their response must be, &quot;I am a woman,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>Dr. Pilipinas Ma. Jare&ntilde;o, OSSA dean and Vice-President of WSAP national, who is also the co-sponsor of the event, stated how Women&#39;s Month Celebration had since served as a venue to highlight women&#39;s achievements and discuss continuing and emerging women&#39;s empowerment, and gender equality issues and concerns, challenges, and commitments.&nbsp;</p>
