<p>Mudpress, which is a residue of the filtration of sugarcane juice from sugar milling companies like the URC-SONEDCO, is one of the great substrates for vermicomposting technology. Hence, a tie-up with an institution that utilizes such material is considered a win-win scheme that guarantees absolute gain for both agencies as each benefit from the engagement. This is likewise viewed as an efficient strategy for solid waste disposal through recycling of organic matter.</p>

<p>With CPSU Ilog campus as an ardent advocate of organic farming that makes use of vermicomposting technology as an eco-friendly and best organic fertilizer in growing their crops and vegetables than chemical fertilizers, having this partnership with the milling company is viewed as both a boon and a blessing since it will strengthen organic production in their campus.</p>
