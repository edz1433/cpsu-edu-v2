<p>The goal of Central Philippines State University (CPSU) to bring education to the marginalized sectors of the community to break the chain of poverty especially to the farmers and destitute families in the community has led to its partnership with the Municipality of Valladolid who also share the same aspiration of providing access to quality and free tertiary education to their underserved and displaced students.</p>

<p>The realization of this partnership was sealed during the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of CPSU-Valladolid Technical Vocational Institution (TVI) and proposed extension class last February 27, 2021.

Bagumbayan, Valladolid through the donation of 20,000 sq.m. lot area by the owners of the property through their representative, former Mayor Magdaleno &ldquo;Magsie&rdquo; Pe&ntilde;a. This was made possible through the request of Mayor Enrique Miravalles for the construction of the CPSU building.</p>

<p>Prof. Sharon Rose Lin T. Masa, head of the Technical Working Group (TWG) of the said project, stated that this noble endeavor would not have been made possible if not for the determination of the good Mayor of the Municipality of Valladolid, Hon. Enrique Miravalles. Sharing this same dream of providing free tertiary education to all are the great minds of CPSU headed by Dr. Aladino Moraca CPSU President, Dr. Fernando Abello, VP for Academic Affairs, together with their administrative and academic council.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This aspiration converges with the mission of CPSU anchored to the institution&rsquo;s vision. To pursue this project, the Mayor of Valladolid and the President of CPSU embarked on this joint partnership to establish this first-ever tertiary educational institution in the Municipality, the CPSU Valladolid extension and Technical-Vocational Institution,&rdquo; Prof. Masa said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dream of every Dolidnon to have access to quality, free tertiary education has now become a reality. Today, we celebrate the breaking of the ground for the construction of CPSU Valladolid Extension class and Technical-Vocational Institution (TVI),&rdquo; Prof. Masa added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will ensure education to our underprivileged students. This will also serve as blessing to our agriculture sector through the programs that will be offered by CPSU. Some of which are the Bachelor in Agri-Business (BSAB) and the short-term course in organic agriculture NC II,&rdquo; Mayor Miravalles said.</p>

<p>Mayor Miravalles also expressed gratefulness to the support of the people behind this realization. Foremost, to the&nbsp; donors of the property represented by Hon.

<p>&ldquo;This is a wonderful project that could help many youth in the Municipality. One of the challenges of students that caused them to drop out from school is their daily expenses required for fare and dormitory allowance. Now, with the establishment of this project, they can pursue their studies without having to think of such expenses since it is just within their municipality,&rdquo; Sen. Gatchalian said.</p>

<p>In response, CPSU President Dr. Aladino Moraca, said that the University&rsquo;s purpose is to contribute in addressing the problems on free and accessible education, peace and order and sustainable livelihood not just in the community but in the entire Province.</p>

This will now answer concerns on peace and order in the community. The free tertiary education will also help poor students prepare for a brighter future.
