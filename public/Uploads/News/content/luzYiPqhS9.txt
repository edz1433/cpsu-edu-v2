<p>Joining the said event were the CHEDRO VI supervisors, Dr. Boyet Anceno, Sir Paulo Cabanero and Sir Rosslin John Robles, along with the UNIFAST Region VI representatives Dennis Lagmay and Karen Zaldivar.</p>

<p>Their team were welcomed by CPSU president, Dr. Aladino Moraca, along with Dr. Fernando Abello, VP for Academic Affairs, Dr. Mae Flor Psadas, VP for Research and Extension,&nbsp; Dr. Michael Bacolod, Murcia extension class coordinator, Hon. Victor Gerardo Rojas, Municipality of Murcia Mayor, Dr. Norberto Mangulabnan, CHMSC president, Dr. Renante Egcas, NONESCOST president, Mrs. Mariam Castel, VP for Academics of the Catholic Ming Yuan College, Mr. Ramon Uy of the RU Foundry, the CPSU campus administrators, deans and directors, faculty and staff.</p>

<p>Part of the said visit of Chair de Vera was to celebrate the successes of tertiary education in the country especially in surmounting the challenges faced amid the pandemic, and the promotion and strengthening of the Padyak Edo-tourism program to claim victory for free higher education in the whole Philippines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his speech, Hon. De Vera recognized the significant role and contribution of the University officials, faculty and students in the concerted efforts for education and learning to continue through flexible learning.</p>

<p>And for the first time, the government officially recognized the importance of higher education through the signing of RA 11522 designating May 18 of every year as National Higher Education Day.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maraming salamat sa lahat ng Universities. Kung hindi tayo naniwala na kaya natin, things would have gotten worse. Now, we are on the brink of reopening our schools and welcoming back our students. This is also the time to thank our local government for working with our universities for the interest of our students. Without the support and collaboration of the universities and local governments, we wouldn&rsquo;t have achieved what we have done now. Because of the spirit of &ldquo;bayanihan,&rdquo; the best of the Filipinos always emerges,&rdquo; de Vera stated.</p>

<p>He further stated that because of free higher education, tertiary education subsidy (TES) and Tulong Dunong scholarship grants, more than two (2) million young Filipinos in more than 200 public universities were given the opportunity to complete their education as they no longer have to pay for their tuition and other school fees.</p>

<p>Dr. Moraca likewise responded by stating his gratefulness for the support of the government in the initiatives of State Universities to further vitalize education in the country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We always work on creating schemes so that in what we do, we are able to show to our students &lsquo;na ang mukha ng SUCs ay ang mukha ng tunay na gobyerno.&rsquo; And since CPSU is focusing on technology-generation as evidenced by the many innovations, machines and technologies it has created and shared to the community, this is our contribution for industry development in the countryside through efforts being promoted by CPSU, partner SUCs and private sectors to address the needs of the poor through education for economic alleviation,&rdquo; Dr. Moraca explained.</p>

<p>Mayor Rojas also expressed how their partnership with CPSU to open an extension class in their locality had been a realization to their dream. He extended his sincere thanks to the University for positively responding to their request through endorsement to the Board of Regents, and to CHED through Chair de Vera for the approval in the opening of the extension class. Now, the Murcia youth can gain access to free tertiary education right in their municipality.</p>

<p>Prior to the program, the CPSU team presented its various technologies and innovations in support to the institution&rsquo;s advocacy on agriculture development and livelihood interventions for the community such as the tractor for conservation agriculture, sweet potato flour machine, mushrooms, sardines, muscovado sugar, solar-powered water pumping and lighting system, organic pandesal, and many others.</p>

<p>The working team in the said event was headed by Dr. Michael Bacolod of CPSU Murcia, together with campus administrators from Victorias campus Sir Noel Fordente, Moises Padilla campus Sir Patrocenio Gonzales, CBM dean Sheila Ignacio, Municipality of Murcia LGU, Cauayan campus Dr. Germa Borres, San Carlos campus Dr. Moody Deocares, OSSA dean Dr. Pilipinas Ma.
