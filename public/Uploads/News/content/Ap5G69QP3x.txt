<p>Among the highlights of the talk of Dir. Alvarez is his perspective regarding the sustainability of free higher education.

<p>Meanwhile, in alignment with the Regional Development Plan, Ms. Tigres suggested that one of the strategies that should be included in the University plan is &ldquo;to optimize the role of colleges and universities as [knowledge] innovation hubs and incubation centers for the region to establish a knowledge-based economy.&rdquo;</p>
