<p>As a catalyst of social and economic development, CPSU not only provides livelihood to its surrounding communities but also creates hope for a transformed life to rebel returnees through technology transfer of various practical climate-suitable, and environment-friendly agriculture practices and innovations that ensure food security and sustainable livelihood for them and their families.</p>

<p>In partnership with TESDA, the University being an accredited training provider for Organic Agriculture Production, through the College of Agriculture and Forestry (CAF), provided free training to 25 rebel returnees identified as TESDA scholars which started last November 12, 2020 in Locotan, Kabankalan City. Expected to be completed on the second week of January, 2021, this will educate trainees on the importance and benefits of organic farming.</p>

<p>This scholarship program of TESDA known as the Training for Work Scholarship Program or TWSP is composed of four sets of training. The First set, conducted in 8 days, focused on producing organic vegetables. The second set, conducted in 9 days, gave emphasis on raising organic chicken. The third set, on-going, expected to be completed in a span 15 days, aims to capacitate trainees in making solar-powered water pumping system for small irrigation. The lead trainer in these sets is Dr. Ervin Ferraris, CAF instructor in the main campus, as assisted by Sir Raymond Bongcalon of Cauayan Campus for the first two trainings, together with Sir Mark Anthony Miran of Bantayan National High School; while Sir Jundel Gonzaga, from the main campus, assisted in the third set. The last set, which is good for 16 days, will focus on enabling trainees in organic sugarcane production. The training will be headed by Ma&rsquo;am Mary Ann Ca&ntilde;ada, CAF instructor, together with the Bachelor in Sugar Technology (BST) instructors.</p>

<p>Aside from the knowledge and practical life skills that it gives to the beneficiaries, the said scholarship grant of TESDA likewise provides training allowance, training kits per set, and living allowance, including a life insurance good for one year to each of the trainees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This enhances their knowledge and skills in producing organic vegetable and in raising organic chicken. This also sustains their livelihood, the needs of their respective families and community members as a whole, in which they were able to plant different types and varieties of vegetable and also to create and construct their free range area for their native chicken as their starter project,&rdquo; Dr. Ferraris stated.</p>

<p>Seeing how the trainess dedicated themselves in learning all the methods taught to them, Dr. Ferraris particularly explained the positive impact that this training had done. &ldquo;This developed their eagerness to learn, participate in every activity and enhance their usual practices by the scientific methods of raising organic chicken and producing organic vegtables,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>With these agricultural technologies introduced to the trainees, progress through social equity is indeed the steadfast goal of this collaboration between CPSU and TESDA based on their slogan, &ldquo;Abot Lahat&rdquo;. This endeavor is directed towards the aim of improving rebel returnees&rsquo; quality of living through ensuring peaceful and sustainable sources of income as they reintegrate in the mainstream society and start their lives anew. &nbsp;(Source: M.A. Ca&ntilde;ada&nbsp;&nbsp; Photo credits: E.
