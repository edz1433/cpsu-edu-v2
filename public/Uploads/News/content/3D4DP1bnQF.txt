<p>Central Philippines State University proudly waves its banner of victory after gaining the 158th spot among the 300 participating universities worldwide in the recently concluded 2023 World Universities with Real Impact (WURI) ranking for the Global Top Innovative Universities.</p>

<p>Said results were unveiled by Dr. Hwy-chang Moon, founding director of WURI Ranking, during the Hanseatic League University (HLU) conference held at Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers, USA last May 15-17, 2023.</p>

<p>As its first-time quest in the WURI Ranking, CPSU takes pride in this achievement. The University submitted entries in three categories, Industrial Application, Entrepreneurial Spirit and Crisis Management.</p>

<p>WURI is among the competitive Impact Rankings worldwide that evaluates universities&rsquo; real contributions to society, highlighting creative and innovative approaches of universities&rsquo; research and educational programs based on WURI&rsquo;s six (6) key pillars. These are Industrial Application, Entrepreneurial Spirit, Ethical Value, Crisis Management, Progress in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, Student Mobility and Openness.</p>

<p>This success is owed to the CPSU Internationalization team who are behind this achievement. The Core Team is headed by Dr. Aladino Moraca, CPSU president, together with the former director for International Affairs, Dr. Denis Bilocura, along with Dr. Josephine Asuncion Emoy, Dr. Aubrey Ginelle Rallos, Dr. Marjon Malacapay, and Dr. Rosemarie Gallardo.</p>

<p>Also part of the team are Dr. Angelie Rose Lumba, Dr. Maryvic Pedrosa, Dr. Jimmy Degillo, Dr. Chim Misajon, Dr. Manilyn Mananap, Dr. Joean Mae Escober, Dr. Jenesa Dayono, Dr. Analou Paculanang, Mrs. Aileen Belleza, Ms. Michelle Sipat, Sir Reymark Agita and Ms. Joannie Magbanua.</p>

<p>CPSU also extends its gratefulness to Tarlac Agricultural University (TAU), partner SUC, for their generosity and the inputs they unselfishly shared during the team&rsquo;s benchmarking activity in their campus.</p>

<p>This success is solid proof of the quality, relevance, sustainability, and practicality of the institution&rsquo;s programs, innovations and initiatives that are being extended to the community, and the impact it has created on the lives of those it has changed.</p>
