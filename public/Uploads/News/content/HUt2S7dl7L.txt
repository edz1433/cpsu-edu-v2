<p>With a total of 120 HIMALIKASFA farmer beneficiaries, the said agri-training known as Farmers Field School (FFS), which started August of 2022, was held at Purok Hinawanan HIMALIKASFA office. While the CARCFA with 35 members, were given technical assistance for the start-up of their village banking, with regular sessions held at Purok Crossing Payong, CARCFA office.&nbsp;</p>
