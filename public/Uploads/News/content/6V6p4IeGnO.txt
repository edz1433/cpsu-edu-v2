<p>Driven with the aim of making the country economically developed and fully industrialized, the Philippine Economic Zone Authority or PEZA has identified select special economic zone institutes in the country to be partners with them in fulfilling this goal.</p>

<p>Such is the challenge and opportunity bestowed to Central Philippines State University (CPSU) upon being chosen as the special eco-zone not only in the Province of Negros Occidental but in the entire Western Visayas region.</p>

<p>Last September 23, 2020, the cyber launching ceremony of the Special Economic Zone Institute (SEZI) of the Philippine Economic Zone Authority and CPSU was held through Zoom live conferencing. This was virtually attended by the CHED Chairperson and the Chair of the CPSU Board of Regents (BOR), Hon. J. Prospero E. De Vera, III, the Director General of PEZA, BGen Charito B. Plaza, the Regional Director of the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) in Region VI and a member of the CPSU BOR,&nbsp; &nbsp; Hon. Ro-Ann A. Bacal, the Regional Director of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and also a member of the CPSU BOR, Hon.&nbsp; Rowen R. Gelonga, the Regional Director of CHED Region VI, Hon. Maura Consolacion D. Cristobal, the Kabankalan City Mayor, Hon. Pedro P. Zayco, along with the other national and regional partners, witnesses and stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Together with them were their CPSU counterparts headed by Dr. Aladino C. Moraca, University President, Mrs. Jane T. Toledo, Records Officer, Dr. Merlindro Vargas, Director for Production and Enterprise Development, Dr. Marc Alexei Caesar Badajos, Vice-President for Finance and Administration, Dr. Fernando D. Abello, Vice-President for Academic Affairs, Mrs. Victoria Besana, Executive Secretary to the Office of the President, Dr. Angelie Rose Lumba, Director for Research and Extension, and Mrs. Mary Grace Noreen Leduna, ISA coordinator.</p>

<p>Dr. Moraca emphasized in his speech that being identified by PEZA as its partner in the development and management of the special economic zone in Region VI is a huge opportunity for the University in strengthening its readiness in complementing the future projects and developments in the province and the entire region. &ldquo;With a total of 4,653.7 ha. reservation area, this partnership will serve as the University&rsquo;s initial take off towards the realization of its plans as reflected in CPSUs Comprehensive Land Use Plan (CLUP) in maximizing its resources and becoming instrumental in the management and innovation in the fields of research, instruction, production and extension, which are also the main functions of the institution. With the plan&rsquo;s emphasis of creating and developing CPSU as a &ldquo;greenland city&rdquo; through the establishment of economic zones like the tourism economic zone, agro-industrial economic zone, and I.T. parks and centers, among others, this will promise better employment opportunities to the local and neighboring communities, more revenues to the government in the form of taxes and will provide greater opportunities for local and foreign investments. Hence, this activity is one significant milestone that is worth remembering in the history and existence of CPSU,&rdquo; Dr. Moraca stated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are some of the highlights in the vision of PEZA and CPSU which aims for the internationalization of exports-based investments, professionalization of the personnel of the economic zone administration and the proliferation of export literate workforce in Western Visayas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In terms of the institution&rsquo;s preparedness for this commitment, Dr. Moraca emphasized that the University&rsquo;s current initiatives are geared for economic zone development of the province and the region. These include first, the flour industry development project in partnership with the Provincial Government of Negros Occidental and the local government unit of Kabankalan to maximize the underutilized root crops by the farmers; second, the production of safe and healthy food through organic farming practices in partnership with the farmers in its reservation area including other neighboring farmers and Indigenous People (IPs) in Negros Occidental and Oriental; third, development of practical and appropriate technologies, tools and equipment to support agricultural productivity. Some of these are the flour machine developed and perfected by the University R and D team, the development of the first tractor of the country in partnership with an international private sector, and its on-going project on essential oil production and processing. Fourth is the establishment of community-based and center-based education agri-eco tourism; and fifth is the production and processing of the natural muscovado sugar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These projects and programs will ensure food security and self-sustainability, creation of wealth at the local levels, more concrete livelihood activities and opportunities, and the development and adoption of life-changing technologies,&rdquo; Dr. Moraca added.</p>
