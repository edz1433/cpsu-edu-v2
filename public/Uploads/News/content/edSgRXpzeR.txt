<p>The said Memorandum of Agreement was signed by H.E. Dr. Ngo Bunthan of RUA and Dr. Aladino Moraca as represented by Dr. Angelie Rose Lumba for CPSU, during the 3rd International Sustainable Agricultural Intensification and Nutrition (SAIN3) research conference held at Siem Reap, Cambodia last June 27-28, 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was attended by CPSU delegates Dr. Lumba, director for Research and Development, and Dr. Joe-An Mae Escober, Murcia extension class coordinator, who also presented their papers in the same event.</p>

<p>Expected programs and engagements arising from the said partnership are exchange of scholars and professors for lecture and short-term visits, participation of scholars in conferences, symposia and instructions, exchange of agri-related information, academic materials and publications in the fields of mutual interest.</p>
