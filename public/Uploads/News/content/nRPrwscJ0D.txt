<p>As a tie-up project with the community and the LGU of Negros Occidental, in line with the upcoming inauguration of the agricultural tramline, this initiative aims to respond to the long-standing dilemma of the community in terms of accessibility to potable water supply in their area.</p>

<p>Residents used to carry gallons of water as they walk through steep, ragged and dangerous terrains to get to their water source in the area which is inside a deep cave. This chore, usually done by women and children, has become part of their daily routine not minding the great risks and perils it may pose to them.</p>

<p>Dr. Aladino Moraca, CPSU president, stated that waterless communities and far-flung areas that still largely depend on wells and springs for water source, are the target recipients of the University&rsquo;s extension initiatives.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is in these off-grid communities that CPSU makes its programs be felt especially to the underprivileged households. To address the issues on water in the area, as well as the safety of their women and children, this project was realized,&rdquo; Dr. Moraca explained.</p>

<p>Maryvic Pedrosa, CAF Extension Coordinator, further added that the goal of the project was to build and maintain transformation efforts in water supply that is sufficient and reliable for the residents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have installed a 180-meter hose from their source [in the cave] going to the water tank. Now, they have easy access to water supply for domestic and backyard use,&rdquo; Ma&rsquo;am Pedrosa said.</p>

<p>This is part of the CPSU&rsquo;s sustainable targets as the area has been identified to be the future extension program beneficiary of the University for agri-eco tourism, livelihood and training site for its business Management and Engineering programs, especially with the opening of the agricultural tramline.</p>
