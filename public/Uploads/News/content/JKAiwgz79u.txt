<p>Starbook is a stand-alone information source designed to reach-out those with limited access to S&amp;T information resources. The project with its benefits as discussed by the DOST coordinator, Sir Russel Renz Garcia, aims to provide Science, Technology, and Innovation-based content in various formats to students and other constituents in geographically-isolated and economically-challenged schools and communities throughout the country. Starbooks software contains hundreds of thousands of digitized science and technology resources in various formats (text and video/audio) placed in specially designed &ldquo;pods&rdquo; set in a user-friendly interface.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Food Safety and &ldquo;Pinggang Pinoy&rdquo; as discussed by DOST VI director, Engr. Allan Francis Dara-ug, aims to educate and urge every Filipino family to provide a balanced meal even with their usual food available at home. He particularly raised the awareness of participants on the proper handling of foods.</p>
