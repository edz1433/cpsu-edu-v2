<p>Kabankalan City &ndash;&nbsp; The rehabilitation of the Agricultural Tramline connecting So. Milanuha, Brgy. Tagukon, and the southern post of Brgy. Inapoy, Kabankalan City, finally placed an end to the long-standing travail of rural farmers in the area as they now enjoy the ease of hauling their farm produce to the market. This practical technology allows them to save huge time in transporting their goods from the usual three to four hours travel, cutting it to almost 3 minutes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Along with the theme &ldquo;Empowering People, Improving Lives,&rdquo; the ceremonial turn-over took place last July 21, 2022 at So. Minaluha, Brgy. Tagukon, Kabankalan City, which was graced by the Negros Occidental Governor Hon. Eugenio Jose &ldquo;Bong&rdquo; Lacson, together with the provincial and city officials.</p>

<p>In the realization and sustainability development of the said project, CPSU was identified as one of the five (5) pillars along with the Province of Negros Occidental and the Office of the Provincial Agriculturist (OPA) as its main proponents, together with the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the City of Kabankalan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Part of CPSU&rsquo;s role is to ensure the viability and longevity of the project&rsquo;s purpose, particularly on its technical aspects to oversee the operational maintenance of the machine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Likewise, with the tramline now up and running, the goal of the University is to develop the area as a local agricultural hub to promote rural eco-tourism, improve transportation, provide farm-to-market livelihood inputs, and education, among others.</p>

<p>Present during the said event were Kabankalan City Mayor Pedro Zayco, Sir Ricky Moscosa, CPSU President Dr. Aladino C. Moraca, among others.</p>
