<p>As an immediate response to prepare instructors for the coming opening of classes adopting the new normal mode of delivering classroom instructions through flexible learning method, Colleges in the Main Campus conducted a University-Wide Module Writeshop to ensure that students will receive quality education despite these most challenging times in the country&rsquo;s education sector.</p>

<p>The rigid writeshop aimed to include all faculty in the extension campuses who are handling the same courses for collaborative teaching and inputs sharing in the preparation of their modules following the University format presented during the webinar conducted by the IMPDC Office.</p>

<p>In particular, the <strong><em>College of Arts and Sciences</em></strong> (CAS) headed by its college dean, Dr. Maria Lorina B. Crobes, scheduled the General Education Courses (GEC) training in a span two weeks with two days set for each GEC group. Likewise, the <strong><em>College of Teacher Education</em></strong> (COTED) under the leadership of Dr. Riza Stephanie A. Alfaras, college dean, had set their writeshop for all their Professional Courses in two weeks with two days allotted for each Professional course. The <strong><em>College of Business and Management </em></strong>(CBM) led by Ms. Sheila A. Ignacio, college dean, had also set their schedule for the writeshop from July 20-21, 2020. Instructors throughout the campuses were grouped and assigned their Hospitality Management courses to prepare. Meanwhile, the <strong><em>College of Agriculture and Forestry </em></strong>(CAF) and the <strong><em>College of Computer Studies </em></strong>(CCS) each conducted a Zoom meeting last July, 20, 2020 (CAF) and July 27-28, 2020 (CCS), respectively to their faculty members throughout the campuses to discuss among themselves their process of distributing subjects for module preparation.</p>

<p>The output of each college and/or group will be utilized as a University-wide learning resource and the faculty members who participated will be identified as authors of their modules. With this endeavor, the University had high hopes that through this, the institution would be prepared for the coming opening of classes. Though this is something that no one had anticipated, yet with everyone&rsquo;s collaboration and dedication to the work all in the name of &ldquo;access to quality education for students&rdquo;, no obstacle was too much to hurdle, making the tasks more bearable and possible for everyone.</p>
