<p>Under the blazing heat of the sun, with the &lsquo;banderitas&rsquo; swaying swiftly with the wind, CPSU held its 76th Foundation Day Anniversary at CPSU main campus, on October 2, 2022 Sunday.</p>

<p>Delegates were coming from the CPSU-main students and extension campuses, namely: Sipalay, Cauayan, Candoni, Hinigaran and Moises Padilla campus. A thanksgiving mass to bless the university&#39;s week-long celebration was celebrated by Most Rev. Bishop, Louie P. Galbines SThD DD, Rev. Fr. Richard Lachica, and Rev. Fr. Ritchie Villaflor, facilitated by the OSSA-multi faith services, held at the university sports field.</p>

<p>Parade of all delegates followed starting from the main gate going to the university sports field wearing colored t-shirts assigned for each unit; proudly raising their banners. Despite the warm weather and the judging heat of the sun, everyone did not hesitate to make each turn an indelible one. Huge smiles are plastered on their lips, loud yet considerate laughs echoed throughout the pathways where they pass, and lightweight bodies made their way to finish the parade.</p>

<p>The presence and performance of the Philippine Army showing off their tactics also gave spice to the formal opening of the program. All are just a kickstart of the event &mdash; an epitome of euphoria painting a picture-perfect memory worthy to be put in canvas.</p>

<p>The essence of the University week is not just about having fun with the games, meeting and making friends from other campuses, and enjoying the bonds with everyone, it would be meaningless if delegates haven&#39;t had any words of encouragement to awaken everone&rsquo;s spirit, the spirit of how amazing it is to be a Cenphilian.</p>

<p>In the opening program, giving his message of inspiration was the former student of CPSU who never had the second thought of coming and inspirited everyone with his presence. He is now Sipalay City&#39;s Sangguniang Panglungsod, Hon. Ralph Alvarez.</p>

<p>Speaking in front of the crowd, with his humor and warm vibes, he had the chance of talking and interacting with young people who glammed up the event. He highlighted his advocacy of helping CPSU students to reach their dreams through Scholarship Programs. Ending his speech, he said that the event should foster camaraderie, and unity among CPSU participants. &quot;At the end of the day we&#39;re all family,&quot; SP Alvarez added.</p>

<p>Also inspiring everyone with his message was former NOAC and NSCA president, Dr. Marcelino Dechavez. Dubbed as the rock of ages, his message is engulfed with his love and pride for CPSU. The voice of a grateful and honored man who speaks of the great achievements of the university having come this far, and how its students should be grateful about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As already said, we cannot stop moving forward or even backward, you have already started your tertiary education, take hold of yourselves and study hard. Make this University be an avenue for peace, love, labor and unity, long live CPSU,&quot; Dr. Dechavez stated.</p>

<p>Another man of service with an inspiring story is the very own Kabankalan City mayor, Hon. Benjie M. Miranda. He addressed his speech to the students to not only dream but to believe in themselves. &quot;Work hard on your studies, who knows some of you might become the next president of CPSU, or even counselor, vice mayor or even mayor, I was only the typical who dreamed while awake,&rdquo; Hon. Miranda added. The event continued with the raising of the unit banners, significance and entrance of friendship, flame lighting of the urn, athlete&rsquo;s oath of amateurism, athletic officials&rsquo; oath, community dance, the official declaration of the 76th foundation week celebration. Solidarity meeting was held in the afternoon at the University gymnasium.</p>
