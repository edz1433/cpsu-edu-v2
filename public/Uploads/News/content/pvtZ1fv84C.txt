<p>Kapatiran members find new hope in CPSU&rsquo;s reintegration program through practical life skills backed with technology support as they rejoin the mainstream society.</p>

<p>More than 40 Kapatiran members, identified as rebel returnees, from So. Mambinay, Brgy. Locotan, Kabankalan City were the beneficiaries in the said training conducted by the University, together with TESDA who donated a Sugarcane Juicer worth Php 500,00.00. Other partners were the Office of the Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process (OPAPP), Office of the Provincial Agriculturist (OPA), LGU of Kabankalan, City Social Welfare and Development (CSWD) and the 542nd Engineer Construction Battalion.</p>

<p>The series of trainings and workshops provided by the University for sustainable livelihood opportunities to this group had started since November 12, 2020. Grounded on organic farming, one of its highlights was on the planting and production of naturally grown sugarcane utilizing Ring Pit Method in support to its advocacy in Conservation Agriculture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its recently concluded activity held last December 1 - 3, 2021 provided a complete package of the program as it focused on the packaging and marketing of their own manufactured muscovado sugar. These were being sold to partner agencies such as the Phil. Army, Kabankalan City, and to CPSU who primarily facilitated in the dispersal of their products.</p>

<p>Trainers in this complete training packet were the CPSU-Bachelor in Sugar Technology (BST) and Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (BSA) team for the sugarcane planting and production. While, the packaging and marketing of the final product was done by the Bachelor of Science in Agri-Business (BSAB) group.</p>

<p>CPSU president, Dr. Aladino Moraca, stated that this practical method for peace and order and poverty alleviation in the community will pave way for the insurgents to bring back their trust to the government.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As catalyst for social equity and rural industrialization through education and agriculture, we do not only address food security and economic development, but also build hope for a transformed life to rebel returnees through various practical climate-suitable, and environment-friendly agriculture practices and &nbsp; &nbsp; innovations that ensure food sufficiency and sustainable livelihood for them and their families,&rdquo; Dr. Moraca explained.</p>

<p>These are the steadfast goals of the University as it stands true to its aim of being the seed of life-changing technologies.</p>
