<p>Being identified as an advocate of environment protection and conservation, the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) Neg. Occ. partnered with CPSU in collaboration with the Alpha Co. 94 IB, 3rd Infantry Division of the Philippine Army and trained local farmers within the University in a tree-planting activity held last December 8, 2020 at the CPSU Green Technology and around the Research and Development Center or RDEC Building in celebration of the World Soil Day.</p>

<p>With the theme, &ldquo;Hustisya Para sa Kagulangan: A Reforestation Activity of DAR-Neg. Occ. 2 through Its Gender and Development Program (GAD)&rdquo;, the activity is the team&rsquo;s response to the global call to help minimize the ill-effects of climate change by restoring vegetation and lead in educating society on the importance of planting and saving trees. In the entire activity, the group planted a total of 200 locally grown Cacao seedlings</p>

<p>Among the available crops, Cacao seedlings were planted since this is part of the University&rsquo;s initial take-off in its plan to boost the cacao industry in the region as support to rural industrialization. This endeavor likewise reinforces the institution&rsquo;s campaign to popularize chocolate processing in the next three to five years utilizing the Cacao native variety.</p>

<p>In the said activity, there were a total of 18 participants from the Philippine Army, 40 participants from DAR-Neg.Occ. and 25 CPSU personnel headed by VP for Research and Extension Dr. Joel A. Perez, Director for Environment Management System Sir Wendel Pangaral and Graduate School Dean Dr. Mae Flor Posadas, along with other participants who joined the said activity. The group was assisted by the CPSU forest rangers.</p>

<p>Dr. Moraca, CPSU President, highly encourages and supports activities with concerted efforts of multi-stakeholders as one efficient means of forging productive partnerships among various government and non-government agencies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This partnership with DAR is promising since we want this project to be adopted by the agrarian reform communities. We also collaborate with the Philippine army as a support to their program of promoting and enforcing peace and order throughout the country not by uncongenial, violent and discordant means but through extending livelihood assistance to the community since poverty is seen as one of the causes for people&rsquo;s uprising and insurgence,&rdquo; Dr. Moraca explained.</p>

<p>As part of the University&rsquo;s future anticipated projects on cacao production, this will highlight organic farming practice in relation to its current advocacy in partnership with Kansas State University on &ldquo;Conservation Agriculture&rdquo; or no-till farming that increases crop yield while enhancing soil fertility.</p>

<p>Truly, this activity is a reliable surefire formula that answers different environmental, social and economic concerns as it guarantees benefits not only in reforestation and the greening initiatives of the University, but also in maintaining peace and order in the community through food security and sustainable livelihood once the cacao industry in the institution is in its full blow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Photo Credits: R.
