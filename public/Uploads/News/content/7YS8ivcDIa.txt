<p>CPSU stands firm in living its mission of generating and extending leading technologies that would help in alleviating the lives of the farmers in the community and in uplifting the conditions of the local economy by promoting environmentally sound, economically viable, practical and socially responsive technologies and other agri-related farming practices. With this, the University launched its Flour Industry and Development in the Province last July 8, 2020 at Mt. Ballo Hall, CPSU &ndash; Main Campus.</p>

<p>Also present to witness the said event and express their support to the University were the Kabankalan City Mayor, Hon Pedro Zayco, Jr., the Provincial Agriculturist Japhet Masculino, Camingawan Brgy. Captain, Hon. Rico Regalia, and the Proprietor of RU foundry, the silent stronghold of CPSU, Mr. Ramon Uy.</p>

<p>In his speech, Dr. Moraca said that this plan all started from a conversation with Mr. Bobby Magalona on the huge demand of flour in the province. &ldquo;Every month the province consumes 10 tons of flour,&rdquo; he stated. With this, he thought of a way of helping at least 10% of the flour production to satisfy its huge demand of flour in the province.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The role of flour industry especially during this time of COVID 19 pandemic is vital as it has not decreased its demand in the local market. Hence, the city strongly supports this project as one way of preventing hunger during this most difficult times of the country,&rdquo; said Hon. Zayco, Jr., Kabankalan City Mayor.</p>

<p>Having developed its own flour mill, the University, through the team of the CPSU Victorias Campus administrator, Sir Noel Fordente, and Sir Jundel Gonzaga, faculty, who served as the researchers and innovators of the said technology, is now ready to augment the production of flour in the Province to ensure that the flour industry is able to supply its huge demand in the local community. This is part of Dr. Moraca&rsquo;s plan of contextualizing and institutionalizing the promotion of flour industry in the region and in the province.</p>

<p>Part of his target is for the farmers and households in the community to practice self-sustainability by producing their own food that may also be a source of livelihood to their family.</p>

<p>Currently, the University has already started its production of green, golden, black and lavender flour made from locally available indigenous crops such as banana, taro, cassava, camote, ube, biga or Alocasia macrorrhiza, and squash. In fact, the snacks (bread) served during the said event was from the sample flour produced from the machine. This project likewise provides livelihood to farmers by collaborating with them in supplying the needed raw materials for the flour production, making this a sure win-win situation to the University, the province and the local community.</p>

<p>The president also informed everyone that the University has allocated 10 hectares as housing for the farmers&rsquo; families within the campus with its construction to commence this year at So. Lucay. This is in collaboration with Mr. Bobby Magalona of Gawad Kalinga. He also highlighted in his message that in his conversation with Sen. Bong Go, the CPSU Green Village design may be used as model for the homes of the senate&rsquo;s &ldquo;Balik Probinsya&rdquo; Program to workers who are stranded in Manila and whose employments are greatly affected by the pandemic.</p>

<p>After which, the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding among the participating parties were done. This was followed by the Ribbon-Cutting Ceremony led by Hon. Mayor, and assisted by Dr. Moraca, Atty. Masculino, Hon. Regalia, Sir Dela Torre, Sir Muscosa, and the rest of the OPA and PEMO officials.</p>
