<p>Leveraging the art of crafting through recycling to reduce the disposal of used papers within the University is the core idea of the PapeLab, a paper recycling, exhibit and fundraising project of the College of Arts and Sciences. Now on its second-year post-pandemic event, the said activity is hinged towards innovative and creative ways of promoting environmental conservation to students while also creating value for used papers.</p>

<p>Participated by nearly 700 Cenphilian students coming from various colleges, this year&rsquo;s PapeLab Exhibit featured sculpted artworks venturing on various themes and using scrap papers as the primary ingredient mixed with flour, starch, and glue. The creators also took pride in their artwork by embellishing them with organically produced colors from indigenous materials such as turmeric (kalawag), annatto (istiwitis), charcoal, and coffee.</p>

<p>The said activity was finally put into light after weeks of preparation, as the aesthetic display of the outputs were made last June 7-8, 2023 at the MPLC Building-CAS Ground Floor Lobby and Room 3.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The opening program was graced by PEMO-Negros Occidental team headed by Ma&rsquo;am Elena San Jose, together with the BS Forestry program head For. Dominic L. Billen and Prof. Mary Ann S. Dagunan, and the CAS faculty headed by its dean, Dr. Michael Bacolod.</p>

<p>With it came the judging of the creative displays of recycled artworks of the students and among them, the following were declared winners:</p>

<p>The AB Social Science (ABSS) 1B class was awarded the first place winner, followed by the AB Social Science (ABSS) 1A, and securing the third spot was the Bachelor of Science in Agriculture (BSA) 2D.</p>

<p>The success of the said event was realized through the collaborative efforts of the College of Arts and Sciences, headed by their dean, Dr. Bacolod, the CAS Natural and Physical Sciences (NatSci) Division, led by its program head Engr. Maria Cristina I. Canson, and the Arts and Sciences Students Association (ASSOC) led by ASSOC Governor, Michael Sendico, with the help of various sponsors, donors, and supporters that funded the program.</p>

<p>Once again, another event majestically showcased the creative talents and insurmountable vision of Cenphilians. CPSU continues to commit itself to upholding its environmental vision, where education may be its core, but will remain steadfast in campaigning for local conservation as part of its main institutional goals and domains.</p>
