<p>Being identified as an ardent advocate of women&rsquo;s rights, protection and empowerment, VAW and gender equality, Central Philippines State University&nbsp; is one with the nation as it observes the Women&rsquo;s Month celebration.</p>

<p>Through the institution&rsquo;s Gender and Development (GAD) unit headed by Sir Noel Dayono, GAD focal person, a virtual CPSU-wide monthly convocation and GAD focal point system assembly was held last March 8, 2021 with the theme, &ldquo;Juana Laban sa Pandemya: Kaya!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is the University&rsquo;s gesture of gratitude towards women&rsquo;s contribution to society as they have paved the way towards progress, breaking the barriers of inequality and raising the banner of femininity into greater heights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In his speech, Sir Dayono stated that this celebration aimed to acknowledge and give honor to women&rsquo;s remarkable role to society as emblems of selfless love, devotion, care and affection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This activity served as a tribute, a platform, and a call to action that highlights the extraordinary roles of ordinary Juanas in the society as trailblazers and harbingers of change. This is also served as a venue to discuss and address the issues that women continue to face so empowerment can be fully achieved. The campaign is also a call for concrete, sustainable, and inclusive actions towards gender equality, as highlighted by the Philippine Commission on Women (PCW),&rdquo; Sir Dayono said.</p>

<p>He stressed the statement of PCW for this year&rsquo;s celebration, which is quite unique than the previous years since this highlights women&rsquo;s participation in battling the pandemic as well as discusses gender issues exacerbated by the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the time to delve deep into the gender issues that emerged or become more felt during the health crisis, featuring women who thrived despite the circumstances, and shared support systems and government programs that addressed women&rsquo;s issues and concerns,&rdquo; Sir Dayono highlighted.</p>

<p>He further lauded the exceptional and indispensable role that women undertake in battling this covid-19 having managed themselves to stay focused and strong, composed and dependable during these times is worth .&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We salute our women who make a difference to make it better during this trying time. Mabuhay kayo, mga Juana,&rdquo; Sir Dayono added.</p>

<p>The second part of the program was the GAD focal point assembly which was participated by the GAD team members and focal persons across all campuses, including the SSG and FLP federation officers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Discussed here were the finalization of GAD agenda, priority activities and targets as bases in the&nbsp; crafting of the GAD plan and budget. Extension campuses also laid down specific areas of concern needing immediate attention in their respective sites.</p>

<p>Likewise, in observance of this month-long celebration, all CPSU personnel were enjoined to wear purple shirt during Mondays to show their support for the said cause.</p>
