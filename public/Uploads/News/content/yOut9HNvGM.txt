<p>In the realm of higher education, this accreditation by AACCUP as a recognized accrediting body assesses the institution&#39;s quality, performance, and adherence to specific standards and criteria. For CPSU, undergoing this rigorous process is the foundation upon which its engagements and services are being measured thereby establishing its integrity as a higher learning institution. Driven by innovation and technology generation, this is a constant testament to its pursuit for efficient and quality education.</p>
