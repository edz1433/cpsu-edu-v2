<p>Cultivating the spirit of thankfulness for all the good things that 2020 has brought despite the harsh impacts of COVID-19 pandemic served as inspiration to the whole CPSU community in holding the CPSU-Wide Virtual Year-end Thanksgiving last December 18, 2020.</p>

<p>This whole day activity was organized by the Faculty and Staff Federation (FASFED) headed my Mrs. Debbie Lou Enquilino, FASFED president. It started with a thanksgiving mass and was followed by the program proper consisting of messages of key officials and intermission numbers coming from different campuses who rendered songs and dance presentations virtually. The highlight of the program was the message of&nbsp; Dr. Grenny Jungco, Quality Assurance director of the University, and the speaker of the said event.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are actually so many things that we should be thankful for despite the pandemic,&rdquo; Sir Jungco stated.</p>

<p>To mention a few, the University&rsquo;s developments in terms of infrastructures, linkages and partnerships, extension and community programs, the ISO certification throughout all its campuses, the COPCs received for its various programs, the successful CHED NQAT and RQAT evaluations and the AACCUP accreditations, even the zero casualty of&nbsp; the University personnel, as well as for opening new doors and opportunities that couldn&rsquo;t have been discovered or valued if not for the pandemic, like virtual meetings, conferences, webinars and trainings, among others.</p>

<p>Likewise, the CPSU top management expressed their messages of thanksgiving. Particularly, Dr. Fernando Abello, VP for Academic Affairs, specifically thanked everyone for the collaboration and the strong spirit of unity, dedication, camaraderie and for displaying acts of &ldquo;Bayanihan&rdquo; especially in the selfless process of preparing and distributing of modules, and reaching out students in various areas despite possible risks. He also thanked the support staff, non-teaching personnel and local IATF for giving their usual fervent support to the operations of the institution; and to everyone who embraced the &ldquo;new normal&rdquo; trend of the University just to continue providing quality services to all its clienteles.</p>

<p>Engr. Marc Alexei Caesar Badajos, VP for Finance and Admin, also enumerated various reasons that CPSU community should be grateful for despite all the challenges encountered. Even amidst the pandemic, the accomplishments that the University achieved such as the new and on-going infrastructures, the numerous evaluations, audits and accreditations faced and surpassed by the University, including its community and extension activities and linkages locally, nationally and internationally never shackled even a bit as it pursues its goals for development and quality services.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Dr. Aladino Moraca, University president, also gave his inspirational message stating his gratefulness to everyone for unceasingly working hard and staying committed to provide quality services in performing its core functions in research, instruction, extension and production in the new normal set up. He also made everyone internalize that there is hope and strength in working together for the common good.</p>

<p>The second part of the program, which transpired in the afternoon, was the virtual contest per campus. In the main campus, each college and the non-teaching personnel organization (NTPO) submitted their videos as official entries for the various events. These were the Tiktok dance challenge, vocal solo, vocal trio and group singing.</p>

<p>Winners were as follows:</p>

<p>The year 2020 may truly be different from all the rest, but it sure leaves a powerful message to everyone. Being cognizant of the strength gained from unity especially in overcoming hurdles as one team is truly worth celebrating. Sharing this victory together from the sincere and humble tolling of all CPSU personnel serve as confections that create a special bond and pride of being part of the CPSU family.</p>
