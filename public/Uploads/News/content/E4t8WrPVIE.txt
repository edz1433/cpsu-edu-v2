<p>May 3, 2023 &ndash; Central Philippines State University takes pride in being the first and only BI-accredited state university in the Province of Negros Occidental. With the issuance of accreditation by the Bureau of Immigration (BI) - Neg. Occ., the university is now given legal authority to accept foreign students from its partner international universities.</p>

<p>This accreditation likewise gives authority for the University to send students and faculty for exchange programs with international partners as a hallmark in producing globally competitive graduates fully capacitated to meet international demands in their chosen fields.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The said accreditation is issued exactly 2 months after the BI - Negros Occidental team conducted on-site evaluation last March 4, 2023, at CPSU main campus. Among the aspects that the team looked into were on the institution&rsquo;s readiness, effectiveness and adequacy in terms of facilities, laboratories, legalities of programs offered, faculty profile, level II AACCUP accreditation of programs, safe and conducive environment, and level of administrative support to student programs and activities. This realization was through the efforts of Dr. Joean Mae Escober, the Director for International Affairs Office, along with the support of the CPSU administration, and office heads.</p>

<p>This is the University&rsquo;s response to the current priority trend in the country&rsquo;s educational landscape as programs and services are now being delivered across borders. Serving as a headstart for international mobility, this significant leap will be CPSU&rsquo;s contribution in raising the region&rsquo;s educational banner towards internationalization.</p>
