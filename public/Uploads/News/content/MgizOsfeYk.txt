<p>&nbsp;&quot;Overcome and fight these challenges, learn to fight back on these, otherwise you will be overtaken by the development&hellip; You are competing with yourselves. Pass the exam, that is your passport to employment. Study and focus on your goals. Medal is there, but achieving your dream is one thing,&quot; Dr. Abello added.</p>

<p>Gracing the event was Dr. Julius T. Vergara, Dean of the College of Agricultural Sciences and Director of Guimaras State University (GSU), Baterna Campus. He is an alumnus of NOAC during his college years, including his post baccalaureate degrees. He inspired the awardees by sharing his milestones at GSU.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;Always be at your best in all the things that you do. But in working things do not compete because working with competition will end up to anger, not success. To those who were not able to make it, do not despair. Keep trying and study harder. You will have you time,&quot; he stated.</p>

<p>Towards the end, Dr. Vergara congratulated the CPSU administration, faculty, staff, parents, honorees and everyone for doing their best.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The said event was spearheaded by the Office of the Student Services and Affairs headed by Dr. Pilipinas Ma. D. Jare&ntilde;o, OSSA dean. Also present in the activity were Dr. Mae Flor Posadas, VP for Research and Extension, and the respective deans per college.&nbsp;</p>
