<p>The Central Philippines State University (CPSU) through the College of Agriculture and forestry (CAF) continues to extends agri-training, known as the Farmers&rsquo; Field School (FFS), to small-holder farmers in the community as part of its rural socio-economic development initiatives. This activity is hinged on sustainable skill-investment for improved farm inputs through practical and climate-suitable techniques to help farmers augment their harvests, while also managing the health of their land.</p>
