<p>A tradition that has been nurtured and embraced, and mostly anticipated by any new entrant in CPSU is the welcome rites of the Supreme Student Government - SSG to let the students feel the warm and unique greeting of the University as they enter its portals and become official Cenphilians.</p>

<p>Despite the cancellation of face-to-face classes for this school year, the SSG headed by its federated president, Hon. Carlo Boyayot, strategized means to continue this fun culture of welcoming students through various virtual contests which was held last October 31, 2020 via fb live on their page, Cenphilian Republic. This year&rsquo;s theme, &ldquo;Promoting Cenphilians&rsquo; Well-Being Amidst Pandemic&rdquo; focused on the advocacy of resiliency, optimism and better mental health of the new Cenphilians amidst the challenge of the pandemic.</p>

<p>The prescribed attire for students this year was a DIY PPE made from recycled or indigenous materials as one of the categories in the contest. Other categories include Photo Challenge - Hugot Modular Class and Online Class Scenario, Drawing Challenge and Video TikTok : singing, dancing and drama on Online Class/Modular Scenario. Students&rsquo; entries were posted on the SSG fb page and announcement of winners followed a week after, Nov. 7, 2020.</p>

<p>Part of the said activity was the Pledge of Commitment of Central Philippines State University thru its Supreme Student Government in collaboration with the Hope Builders&rsquo; Organization through the launching of its 2nd run of ProSeed: Punla ng Kinabukasan last October 31,2020. This was done through planting seedlings of hardwood trees and fruit-bearing trees in the backyard of students as their commitment to the University in protecting and preserving nature which is one of the virtues of being Cenphilians. Students documented their activity through videos and pictures and posted on the SSG fb page.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Part of the program was the talk of Dr. Pilipinas Ma. D. Jare&ntilde;o, dean of the Office of Student Services and Affairs (OSSA), on Suicide Awareness and Crisis Response Action last November 7, 2020 thru fb live. It aimed to remind and assure all the students that they are not alone, that it is okay not to be okay, but to remember that they can always share and confide their burdens to their trusted peers, family and friends for advice. She also emphasized that the OSSA, the Guidance and Counseling Unit and the SSG would always be available as well, to listen and help them on concerns related to their mental well-being.</p>
