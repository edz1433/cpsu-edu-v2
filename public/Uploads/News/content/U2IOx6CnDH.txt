<p>CPSU is now a member of IFOAM Asia&#39;s sub-organization, the Asian Local Governments for Organic Agriculture (ALGOA).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;The local action of the university in the promotion of and advocacy on organic farming is the vehicle why IFOAM Asia invited CPSU to participate in the International Conference in South Korea,&quot; according to Dr. Aladino C. Moraca, CPSU president. Dr. Moraca attended the ALGOA + 4 International Summit on Organic Agriculture Policy on Sept. 18-20, 2019 at Goesan County (South Korea).&nbsp;</p>

<p>A cooperation agreement was signed during the conference to &quot;set out a concrete cooperation frame to support the development of organic farming and smallholders throughout the Philippines, according to a news article by IFOAM Asia.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier in July, Dr. Moraca had initial talks with the Office of the Provincial Agriculturist (OPA) about a partnership for an additional of at least 500-hectare organic farm in Negros Occidental. The scheme would involve the farmer families of students who are recipients of education subsidies from the government.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ALGOA works with over two hundred local governments in Asia to promote the expansion of organic agriculture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>IFOAM Asia is South Korean non-profit organization that was established as a regional group of IFOAM Organics International in 2012. It has more than 270 members in 22 countries.</p>
