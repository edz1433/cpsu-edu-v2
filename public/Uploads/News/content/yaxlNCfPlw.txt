<p>Propelled with a common aim and mutual desire to strengthen and extend cultural, educational and research endeavors, Central Philippines State University and Kansas State University entered into a Memorandum of Understanding last November 17, 2020 to promote said goals of both institutions which may further extend to any fields and subjects which both parties may identify shared interests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The said agreement, signed by Dr. Aladino C. Moraca, CPSU President, and Richard B. Myers, KSU President, states the cooperation, development and mutual consent of both institutions on the following areas of interest and cooperation; (a) the exchange of scholars and scientists to conduct research of mutual interest, (b) the exchange of professors for lectures and short term visits, (c) invitations to scholars for participation in conferences, symposia and instruction, and (d) exchange of information, academic materials and publications in fields of mutual interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This further emphasizes that both parties recognize this partnership as a foundation of mutual understanding and interest and does not in itself entail any financial obligations for either institution. Moreover, the document does not intend to create legal or binding obligations but serves only as a record of the parties&rsquo; current intentions to enhance the relationship of the institutions.</p>

<p>Dr. Manny Reyes, a Filipino research professor in Kansas State University, the lecturer and speaker of the webinar series with CPSU on Conservation Agriculture that promotes &ldquo;No Till&rdquo; farming, Save and Grow and Regenerative Agriculture, which started last October 1, 2020 up to present (set every Thursday of the week), became instrumental in the process leading to this partnership between the two Universities.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Moraca, &ldquo;This is a good start with promising results for CPSU to partner with an international university. This privilege will open many opportunities for our university especially in our endeavor to innovate in terms of agricultural practices and technologies which are research-based that could also be an essential input for instruction to our students in the academic field.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the current direction of the University to lead in local and global development through research, instruction, extension and production, and to produce competent graduates who can generate and extend leading technologies in multi-disciplinary areas beneficial to the community, this undertaking of CPSU with Kansas State University is another significant step leading closer the realization of its goals.</p>
