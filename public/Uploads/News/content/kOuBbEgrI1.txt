<p>Also present from the LGU of Candoni was Sangguniang Bayan Member SB Bembem Katipunan representing Hon. Mayor Cicero D. Boromeo, and Vice Mayor Maejoy Lambot, together with SB Guardiario. Showing also their support were Sir Benjie Orot, Maam Sherly Tan Pajarillo and Maam Cleopatra C.Alegrado, District Supervisor of Candoni.</p>

<p>In particular, this academic building that will rise soon would serve its primary function to provide a healthy environment (physical, social, and psychological) that is conducive for teaching, learning, and research activities that also promote teachers and students&#39; holistic well-being.</p>

<p>This is indeed a new milestone for Candoni campus that serves as a platform to showcase how they are growing and meeting the institution&#39;s vision, mission, and goals for the future by providing quality education and producing globally competitive professionals.</p>
