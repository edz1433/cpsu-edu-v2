<p>As a response to the city and the province&rsquo;s need for a medical facility that provides technical and medical care, treatment and assistance for pets, livestock, poultry and other animals in the community and the entire province, Central Philippines State University-Victorias Campus in partnership with the Local Government Unit of the City of Victorias held a Groundbreaking Ceremony of the first veterinary hospital last August 14, 2020 to be constructed inside the CPSU Victorias Campus</p>

<p>The structure, being the first in the City and in the entire Negros Island with a total allocated budget of 20 million for the building materials and equipment as funded by the LGU of Victorias City, was realized as a fulfillment of one of the major roles of HEIs like CPSU to answer the needs of the community and to complement government initiatives through projects and partnerships that could benefit locals for their economic and livelihood development. This is likewise a significant take-off for the campus as one of the major requirements in preparation for their offering of the Veterinary Medicine program.</p>

<p>The said activity was witnessed by Mayor Francis Frederick P. Palanca together with the other city officials, as well as the Third District Congressman Jose Francisco Benitez, Councilors Junb Bantug and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/derek.palanca?__cft__%5b0%5d=AZWdG7-oD5KhQu3udB9_pAA8Bn-olnc9HFK0PUBXkIL5qwnOju_cZIhbhUQQIAy1yxjwLbfjI0iICbhHUmgDsIM3DC3VIkBoqyu-QQrhI01eVXhTXEjeWnf9CwitgstZRHI&amp;__tn__=-%5dK-R">Derek Palanca</a>, Central Philippines State University President Aladino Moraca, CPSU - Victorias City Campus Administrator Noel Fordente, City Planning and Development Officer Evangeline B.
