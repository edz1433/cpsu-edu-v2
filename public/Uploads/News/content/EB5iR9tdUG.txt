Camingawan officials and RU Foundry. After a total of 16 weeks of field training, 29 farmers successfully graduated last July 8, 2020 in a ceremony held at the Mt.

Japhet Masculino, City Agriculturis Ricky Muscosa, Camingawan Brgy. Captain Hon.

This will help in ensuring food security of local farmers and underprivileged households. <em>&ldquo;Kung may pagkaon, wala gutom. Kung wala gutom, maayo ang panginabuhi,&rdquo;</em> he stated.
