<p>TUV Rheinland declared that the organization (CPSU) has established and maintained an effective system to ensure compliance with its policy and objectives. The audit team confirmed in line with the audit targets that the organization&rsquo;s management system complies with, adequately maintains and implements the requirements of the standard.</p>

<p>For the visionary leader of CPSU, Dr. Aladino Moraca, who had envisioned the University to reach this far through his dynamic leading, &ldquo;This is a great milestone for CPSU to have all its campuses ISO certified. With the collaboration of everybody who toiled day and night for this achievement, receiving this recognition is the most treasured and priceless reward,&rdquo; he stated.</p>

<p>For SUCs like CPSU, ISO audit is considered the highest level of evaluation that looks into how the institution performs and runs its processes and services based on international standards. This calls for the need of standardizing and streamlining its processes and services for the satisfaction of its clients and other relevant interested parties. Hence, passing this kind of rigid evaluation ensures the top quality services and improvement of the school&rsquo;s overall performance for effective and efficient operation.</p>
