<p>In adherence to CHED Memorandum Order No. 52, s. 2016 or the &quot;Pathways to Equity, Relevance and Advancement in Research, Innovation and Extension in Philippine Higher Education&quot; the Office of the President and the Western Visayas Commission recognized the diligent efforts of the University to conduct Community Extension Programs which are relevant and responsive to the needs of the community and society.</p>

<p>This recognition was awarded during the 1st Regional Quality Awards in celebration of the 2nd National Higher Education Day and 28th CHED Founding Anniversary last May 18, 2022 at the CHED Regional Office VI, La Paz, Iloilo City.</p>

<p>In response, Dr. Jimmy Degillo, Director for Extension and Community Services, extended his gratitude to CHED in behalf of the CPSU administration for recognizing the extension initiatives and programs of the University among the State Universities and Colleges (SUCs) in whole Western Visayas.</p>

<p>&quot;We will continue to uplift the living tradition of the people not only in the CPSU community but also to everyone who needs extension services,&quot; Sir Degillo said.</p>

<p>It could be noted that the University, through its Extension and Community Services Office (ECSO), in collaboration with the various departments, such as the College of Agriculture and Forestry (CAF), College of Computer Studies (CCS), College of Engineering (COE), College of Business Management (CBM), College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), College of Teacher Education (COTED) and all its extension campuses, had been diligently extending various sustainable technical skills and livelihood assistance to the community through training-workshops and technology transfer to help alleviate their economic conditions for a decent gainful living.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As stated by Dr. Aladino Moraca, University President, this is the goal of the University, for its existence to be felt by the underprivileged households, for them to experience first-hand the help of the government.</p>

<p>These life-changing initiatives have brought significant impact to various underserved communities whose beneficiaries include local farmers, farmer associations, women and children in far-flung areas. They are taught with innovative yet practical agri-preneurial skills and practices for increased livelihood opportunities which are beneficial not only in their communities, but in boosting the local economy as well, through support in industry development.</p>
