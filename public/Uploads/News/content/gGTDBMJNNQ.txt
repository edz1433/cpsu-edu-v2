<p>&ldquo;Are Customers Always Right?&rdquo; was Coach Jef&rsquo;s question as he started his talk. He explained the important role of customers in improving one&rsquo;s business.</p>

<p>He also quoted a saying from Mahatma Gandhi saying, &ldquo;Customers are the most important visitors in our premises, they are not dependent on us. We are dependent on them. They are not the interruption in our work. They are the purpose of it. They are not outsiders in our business. They are part of it. We are not doing them a favour by serving them. They are doing us a favour by giving us an opportunity to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ar Romela Arca-Jamarolin, Coordinator of iHelp Negros Occidental Negros extended her warmest thanks to all the individuals who supported the training.</p>

<p>Significantly the program has indeed provided the participants with adequate knowledge on customer and customer services which would prove essential in their future work and business ventures after graduation.</p>
