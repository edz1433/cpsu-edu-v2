<p>&ldquo;I believe that a strong, healthy faculty is essential for the success of our students, and in the achievement of our institutional goals. This convention reflects our dedication to both the professional growth and personal well-being of our teaching personnel. With our University kicking off engagements to strengthen internationalization and technology innovations, no doubt that CPSU can achieve its mission and vision in the years to come,&quot; Dr. Moraca stated.</p>

<p>As the new academic year is about to commence, instructors were also assisted in preparing their unified Course Syllabi, and TOS formatting, as well as the initial crafting of the faculty development plan, which were done per cluster and college.</p>

<p>The fourth day was set for a face-to-face team-building activity held at the Forest Park, Alijis, Bacolod City. All campuses took part in the games and sports, as well as team presentations that drew each other together in a wholesome, fun-filled and memorable day.</p>

<p>As an annual event facilitated by the Office of the Training Services, headed by Dr. Mary Grace Noreen Leduna, with the support of Dr. Fernando Abello, VP for Academic Affairs, this year&rsquo;s activity not only instilled academic and professional development among CPSU instructors across campuses, but more importantly, it placed a strong emphasis on physical and social well-being as participants engaged in various games and fitness activities, fostering camaraderie among colleagues. It is expected that the bonds formed and knowledge gained will not only benefit the individual educators but also bridge a positive impact on the students they serve in the upcoming school year.</p>
