<p>Central Philippines State University (CPSU is one with the goal of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) in realizing its advocacies especially in the midst of the pandemic.

The team was headed by Dr. Michael Bacolod, Murcia extension class coordinator, and Sir Ken Balogo, faculty of CPSU San Carlos campus.&nbsp;</p>

Jose Alden Alipin, OAR, VP for Academics and Fr. Amadeo Lucero, OAR, VP for Student Welfare, and Chairman of Team UNO-R Ram Bikers, giving it a total of 30 bikers in all who trailed from the CPSU Murcia extension class site to Cansilayan going to Abuanan, Sum-ag, Handumanan and finally ending their route at UNO-R campus in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental for a total of almost 60 kilometers ride.</p>
