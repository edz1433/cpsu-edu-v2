<p>The unequivocal roles that women play across different dimensions of society had long broken the social divide that created gender disparity between men and women in the country. The women of today are empowered to contribute and benefit equally from all aspects of development that provide relevant impact to their lives, the community and society.</p>

<p>Enthralled to further vitalize women&rsquo;s emblem in the domestic and social sphere, the Women&rsquo;s and Gender Studies Association of the Philippines, Inc. or WSAP held its 12th national conference with the theme, &ldquo;Designing the Better Normal: Challenges, Connections, Care&rdquo; last May 26-28, 2021 via zoom teleconferencing hosted by the UP Center for Women and Gender Studies (UPCWGS).</p>

<p>Being active, ardent advocates for such cause, Central Philippines State University, through its Gender and Development (GAD) Program, participated in the said event with the aim of gaining current insights, trends, and initiatives that could be a venue for possible benchmarking activities for the institution.</p>

<p>One major highlight in the said event was the keynote speech of the Vice-President of the Republic of the Philippines, Hon. Maria Leonor &ldquo;Leni&rdquo; Gerona Robredo, who reiterated how gender equality is paramount in creating a just and sustainable society. She placed emphasis on how these once taciturn members stepped out to create lasting echoes of their voices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women should be given equal inclusion in all areas of development in society. Towards this direction, women should be equipped to make life-determining choices by participating in developmental process and social change,&rdquo; VP Leni said.</p>
