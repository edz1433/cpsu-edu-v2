<p>Hence, pursuing efforts to protect its natural biodiversity and preserving it to posterity have become the recent roadmap of the University for eco-conservation.</p>

<p>Fast-tracking its realization, a ceremonial launching of the CPSU &ldquo;Center of Agriculture and Biodiversity&rdquo; was successfully held last February 8, 2023 in front of the Old Library Building. The Activity was spearheaded by the Research and Development Office, Extension and Community Services Offices (ECSO), College of Agriculture and Forestry (CAF), and College of Arts and Sciences (CAS).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two (2) identified Local Conservation Areas (LCAs) are the Lagoon as Area 1 being the firefly sanctuary and biodiversity site, while Area 2 is located at the back of the mini hostel and dam. The initiative likewise gave spotlight to the Mt. Ballo &ldquo;Putting Bato&rdquo; Mystical Rock as the highest point of CPSU and is a potential LCA and Ecotourism site. The activity also aimed to feature the Sanduloy, which is CPSU&rsquo;s own version of rice and root crops potpourri.</p>

<p>Dr. Aladino Moraca, CPSU president, stated that the role of preserving and managing natural resources is a vital feat that requires the collective efforts and firm support of LGUs and other agencies sensitive to the needs of the people, especially in terms of biodiversity and culture preservation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Embarking on this collective effort for biodiversity preservation in the local conservation areas (LCAs) with the Province and the City including the community ensures that this endeavor will be sustained up to the next five to ten years. Buligan naton palangga ang dunang manggad,&rdquo; were the words he quoted in emphasizing the purpose of this undertaking.&nbsp;</p>
