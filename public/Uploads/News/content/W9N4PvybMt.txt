<p>Recently, a three-day training workshop on designing and installation of solar-powered water system for small irrigation and household use was conducted by the CAF team headed by Sir Jundel Gonzaga to more than thirty (30) Camingawan-Tagukon Farmers&rsquo; Association (CATAFA) members at So. Mainit, Brgy. Camingawan, Kabankalan City last February 1 - 3, 2021.</p>

<p>The event was co-sponsored by the College of Engineering (COE) headed by its dean, Engr. Rene Dagunan, the Gender and Development (GAD) Office coordinator Sir Noel Dayono, the CPSU Hinigaran Campus headed by its administrator Sir Gregorio Predo, and the Graduate School headed by its dean, Dr. Mary Ann Dagunan who is also a licensed forester.</p>

<p>The said training aimed to support farmers in sustaining their livelihood and in ensuring food security for them and their families. This would give them better footing as they battle on the challenges of economic instability induced by the current pandemic.</p>
