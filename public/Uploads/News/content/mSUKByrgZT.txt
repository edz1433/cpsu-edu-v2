<p>In the spirit of &ldquo;Bayanihan&rdquo; amidst this pandemic, CPSU partners with one of the radio stations in Kabankalan City, the Radyo Bandera Sweet FM 102.9 in delivering important announcements, instructions, news, and other &nbsp;relevant information to the students to ensure that they stay connected and updated with important matters relating to their studies. Last August 15 &amp; 16, 2020, CPSU had started its maiden broadcast with Dr. Flor Lingamen-Carpio as the radio anchor.</p>

<p>Among the first key persons interviewed Saturday were the Dean of Student Services and Affairs Dr. Pilipinas Ma. D. Jare&ntilde;o, the University Guidance Counselor Mr. Michael Brian Arcedas, Dean of the College of Teacher Education Dr. Riza Stephanie A. Alfaras, Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences Dr. Maria Lorina B. Crobes, Dean of the College of Business and Management Ms. Sheila Ignacio and the University Scholarship Coordinator Dr. Lycel Pacheco; while Mrs. Nelly Cabual the CPSU board secretary was also interviewed Sunday.</p>

<p>Basic, necessary and useful information were shared to the listeners such as the brief history of CPSU, programs offered, OSSA services, guidance and counseling services and information regarding admission and enrolment, scholarships offered, protocols when entering school premises, CPSU key officials, mandates, including the main purpose for the regular weekend broadcast of the University.</p>

<p>This was made possible through the generosity and support of the station&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Ramel Y. Uy, to CPSU, who has given the University a free airtime every Saturday at 6:00 &ndash; 7:00 PM and Sunday at 4:00 &ndash; 5:00 PM with the segment name, &ldquo;ABANTE CPSU: EDUKASYON KAG IMPORMASYON. The station&rsquo;s local coverage reaches in the entire CHICKS area particularly in the Municipalities of Candoni, Hinoba-an, Ilog and Cauayan, and the Cities of Kabankalan and Sipalay.&nbsp; Students from other extension campuses not covered in CHICKS area could also view and connect through the station&rsquo;s FB livestream which is a global webpage.</p>

<p>This is a temporary arrangement of CPSU with Radyo Bandera while waiting for its Official radio station in the campus, the Muscovado Sweet FM to operate. Currently, the 180 ft. tower has been installed waiting for the transmitter to be transported from Negros Oriental. This University radio station, expected to be operational anytime this year, will be managed by Dr. Flor Lingamen-Carpio as its radio anchor.</p>

<p>This is one of the initiatives of CPSU in ensuring that students continue to access quality education by adapting flexible and distance learning modalities in the midst of these most trying times in the education sector of the country.</p>
