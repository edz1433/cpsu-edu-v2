<p>In grateful recognition of their outstanding performance, a formal rite was held last November 14, 2022 in front of the Administration Building. Witnessed by all personnel and students, the event started with a parade, followed by the acknowledgment of the 25 passers.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Among them is For. Honeymae O. Petiero, the class Summa Cum Laude and the topnotcher who secured the 6th spot with a rating of 90.75%. She was awarded Php 50,000.00 incentive as part of the support program of the University to inspire its students to strive harder in their studies.</p>

<p>In her speech, For. Petiero expressed her gratefulness to the people behind her success. She narrated her College journey, the struggles she had to go through despite the pandemic, and the various requirements she had to hurdle, along with other pressures that seemed to weigh her down. Yet despite all those, she managed to take them all as stepping stones to reach this success she embraces today.</p>
