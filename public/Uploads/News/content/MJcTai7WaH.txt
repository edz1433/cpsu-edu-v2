<p>Let your blood save lives!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Blood-letting program has been an annual campaign and activity conducted by the university through its Medical Health Unit (MHU), and the National Service Training Program (NSTP), in seeing how donating blood is an essential component of global healthcare.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In partnership with the Negros First Bacolod- Provincial Blood Center, the team once again held the said activity for this year with the theme, &ldquo;Dugo Mo, Kabuhi Ko,&rdquo; last February 20, 2023 at Mt. Ballo Hall, CPSU Main Campus.</p>

<p>A total of 94 blood donors were recorded who were the NSTP students, their parents and relatives, as well as the CPSU personnel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Blood Donation Card was given to the eligible volunteers which were presented to the University Nurse, Mrs. Kristine C. Duran. In this manner, individuals can receive their certification and take benefits from the Negros First Provincial Blood Center&#39;s no-fee service.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main goal of the activity was to promote voluntarism and the regeneration of each individual&#39;s blood cells through blood donation, not just for NSTP students but also for all campus personnel.</p>

<p>This initiative is seen to benefit the students, their families, including the institution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The NSTP office is headed by its director, Dr. Salvador Castor, together with the CWTS and LTS coordinator, Dr. Jose Gay Gallego, while the MHU is headed by the University Nurse Kristine Duran.</p>
