<p>&ldquo;Huge resources require serious management.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a total of 4,653.7 land reservation, this challenge led the University in the immediate formulation of its CLUP or the Comprehensive Land Use Plan. Last July 8, 2020, partner agencies and the brilliant people behind its realization were acknowledged by the University through a Special Program on the Awarding of Certificate of Recognition, which took place at Mt. Ballo Hall, CPSU &ndash;Main Campus.</p>

<p>The Dean of the Graduate School, Dr. Mae Flor G. Posadas, being part of the local core team in the planning of the Project did the honors of unfolding the story behind its realization, which is a product of collective efforts from the City of Kabankalan, the Province of Negros Occidental and the experts from the University. It started as a Forest Land Use Plan in 2018, and underwent series of improvements until it was finally approved by the CPSU BOR in 2019 as the CPSU Greenland Plan. The Final output was a product of the support of the Province specifically the PEMO Office and the City Planning Office of Kabankalan.</p>

<p>After which, certificates of recognition were awarded to the partner agencies from the City of Kabankalan and the Province of Negros Occidental, and to the CPSU core team for the efforts, expertise and huge contribution they have invested towards its realization.
