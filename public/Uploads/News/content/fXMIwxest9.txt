<p>A total of 10 hectares land area, which can accommodate up to 400 houses, was allocated by the University for the said project to provide decent and accessible housing site for the settlers within the said community who are situated in the reservation area of CPSU.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Director for Extension and Community Development Dr. Jimmy Degillo welcomed everyone and expressed appreciation for the support and presence of the city and barangay officials in the launching of the said housing project.</p>

<p>VP for Admin and Finance Dr. Marc Alexei Caesar Badajos stated that this opportunity is an outcome from the desire of the University to help the community. He stated that the realization of this initiative had undergone tedious process of planning to get the University BOR&rsquo;s approval for the granting of the relocation site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the president [Dr. Aladino Moraca] wants is not to oust the settlers but to provide a better housing site for you. This will become a resettlement to all households in this community which will be provided with recreation center, as indicated in the plan. The said project will be similar to subdivisions wherein model houses are being prepared to have uniform building designs,&rdquo; Dr. Badajos explained.</p>

<p>Kabankalan City Mayor Zayco lauded CPSU for realizing this project that will ensure safety and protection of the settlers within the community in terms of their land tenure. He further signified support by allotting a budget of 12 million for the road concreting project in the area to provide ease in transportation of the settlers especially in traversing to other barangays. This will likewise lift possible dangers brought about by the usual muddy and slippery condition of the road in the area.</p>

<p>Vice-Mayor Rivera also stated his commendations to CPSU seeing that shelter is one of the basic necessity of the people. Granting this project to the settlers in the community is a great initiative of the University and ensured everyone of the support of the local government for the success of the project.</p>
