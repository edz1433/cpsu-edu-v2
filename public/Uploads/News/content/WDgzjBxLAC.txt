<p>The University, being proud in its humble beginnings as an agricultural school, embraces agriculture as its flagship course. Through the leadership of its president, Dr. Aladino Moraca, the institution is strengthening its advocacy of helping farmers within the city and the province in terms of natural ways farming by providing lectures, trainings, demos, assisting local farmers in the application of practical farming practices which are environment-friendly and economically feasible, and extending help through giving out technologies developed by the institution to the local community such, solar water pumping system, solar panels, farming tools, and the like. Recently, the University has collaborated with the City of Kabankalan and the Province of Negros Occidental in providing training to the farmers known as the FFS or Farmers Field School. The 16-week training gave comprehensive skills and knowledge to farmers in organic agriculture.</p>

<p>Seeing all these initiatives of the University and its capacity to provide comprehensive &nbsp;trainings on natural farming, the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority or TESDA Region VI granted the Certificate of TVET Program Registration to Central Philippines State University to offer program in Organic Agriculture Production NC II with a duration of 232 hours.</p>

<p>This gesture of trust by TESDA to the University&rsquo;s advocacy and competency is considered a huge honor and another milestone to the unending efforts of the institution in promoting organic farming.</p>
