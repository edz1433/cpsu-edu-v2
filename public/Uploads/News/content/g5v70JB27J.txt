<p>As the world transitions to a sustainable food system and agroecology, various government and non-government organizations have initiated projects that promote and implement community-based conservation and sustainable use of plant genetic resources.</p>

<p>CPSU, being recognized as an agriculture-based institution, also shared the same legacy of extending these practices to the farmer communities within its locality and even beyond borders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, Dr. Maryvic Pedrosa, the University director for Production and Enterprise Development and a faculty of the College of Agriculture and Forestry (CAF) was invited by the Southeast Asia Regional Initiatives for Community Empowerment (SEARICE), Inc. to speak on the topic Agroecology to the Farmer Field School (FFC) facilitators in Lao Cai province, Viet Nam last June 16-18, 2023.</p>

<p>In partnership with the Center for Initiatives on Community Empowerment and Rural Development (ICERD) and Thai Nguyen University Lao Cai campus, SEARICE has been implementing the project on agroecology in six communities of the said province.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The aim of the project was to capacitate the FFS facilitators on the principles of Agroecology so as to deepen their understanding on its key principles and elements. Further, it aimed to enhance their knowledge and skills on soil health and nutrition, as well as proper soil management.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the insights they gained, they would then transfer this to the farmers in the six partner communities in Viet Nam specifically in improving their farm soil in order to sustain its productivity with the use of organic inputs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This proves how CPSU&rsquo;s expertise have been recognized around the globe, and how its impact has reached far and wide with its advocacy of natural farming, conservation agriculture, environment protection, and sustainable livelihood to farmer communities.</p>
