<p>The Central Philippines State University- Victorias Campus takes pride with their first-ever topnotcher in the Licensure Examination for Teachers in the person of Meldy Senayo Lubrico, an alumna of the Bachelor of Elementary Education program, batch 2019. She ranked 10th with an average rate of 90.00%. She took the LET, along with the other 3 alumni, last September 2021 in Bacolod City.</p>

<p>On an interview, she was asked if she was expecting to top the board exam. &ldquo;Wala gid ko nag expect sir. Ang akon lang makapasar lang sa board exam, okay na gid ko,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Two years na daan nagligad sir, indi na ko confident sa self ko,&rdquo; she added. Meldy was supposed to take the LET on March 2020, but was postponed for almost two years due to the global pandemic.</p>

<p>Recalling her experiences during the examination day, she was praying that she would not get anxiety attacks while answering. &ldquo;I was very anxious with my answer sheet kay may ara sg gisi (tear) sa kilid. I kept on asking the proctor kun okay lang na, kag mabasahan lang sang machine akon personal information kag answers.&rdquo; This made her become worried.</p>

<p>Meldy is the eldest among the 4 siblings. Her mother is blessed to have her. &ldquo;Nag give way gid na sya danay sir para maka eskwela iya mga manghod,&rdquo; told her mother. Indeed, a good daughter. &ldquo;Elementary pa lang sya sir, honor student na na sya. Naggraduate na sya nga valedictorian,&rdquo; her mother narrates. She was even a declaimer back then.</p>

<p>Her classmates and teachers were actually expecting her to top the exam as she was a consistent dean&rsquo;s lister back in her college years. No wonder why she graduated as Magna Cum Laude, and received various recognitions such as Best in Thesis Award. She was also a champion in Dagliang Talumpati, representing the College of Teacher Education&mdash;undeniably, a precious gem of the college.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To become a teacher, you need to have passion for teaching. Be determined! Embrace the importance of teaching and always love what you are doing!&rdquo;&mdash;these were the powerful yet inspiring words of Lubrico when asked about her message to the students who aspire to become teachers. She had also emphasized her humble gratitude to her Alma Mater and teachers for the impact they had on her. &ldquo;Thank you so much for all that you&rsquo;ve done for us over the years! You helped us shape ourselves, and gain success in life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The school is proud with its 100% passing rate for the Elementary Level in the recently concluded LET. The Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) had announced that 4, 883 (55.96%) out of 8,726 examinees had successfully passed the licensure exam, from which, 3, 908 are first timers, and 975 are repeaters. Lubrico&rsquo;s victory plus the highly commendable passing rate are certainly delightful early Christmas gifts to CPSU-Victorias Campus family.</p>
