<p>Seeing the relevance of the convention to the current needs of CPSU in providing student services and in responding to matters related to student affairs for benchmarking purposes, a total of 15 OSSA practitioners coming from the main and&nbsp; satellite campuses were endorsed to participate in the said event.</p>

Jare&ntilde;o, the coordinator of the Counseling and Guidance Services Mr. Micheal Brian Arcedas, the adviser of the Student Publication Dr. Josephine Asuncion Emoy, the SSG Federated representative Hon.

<p>In the entirety of his talk, he emphasized on the significance of Student Affairs assessment in order to identify current scenarios, demands and effective actions and strategies for the students&rsquo; welfare.&nbsp;</p>

Assessment serves three major roles - to support and enhance student learning; to foster accountability, since we answer to our stakeholders; and for accreditation and evaluation purposes since we aim for higher goals,&rdquo; Dr. Ludeman explained.</p>

<p>During the parallel session, there were a total of 22 paper presenters, with each focusing on studies within the identified research streams: (a) innovative programs for student development and wellness, (b) models and strategies for student discipline and formation, (c) impact and development of community engagement, (d) inclusive education an student affairs and services, and (e) SAS response to the challenges in the new normal.</p>
