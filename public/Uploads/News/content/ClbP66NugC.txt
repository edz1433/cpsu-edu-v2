<p>Part of the said visit was also to bolster up the two institution&rsquo;s newly launched Go Native App which is an e-merchandising, market and shop for local farmers, business owners and shoppers.</p>

<p>Sir Manny likewise met with the College of Engineering faculty and students and discussed innovative practices and ideas related to technology and agriculture.</p>

<p>Dr. Moraca stated that this visit of its international partner, through Dr. Manny Reyes, is a jumpstart for continued engagements and projects in the future.

<p>&ldquo;This is how glocalization is realized in our level. This will open many opportunities for our University especially in our endeavor to innovate in terms of agricultural practices and technologies which are research-based that serve as essential input for extension programs and instruction to our students in the academic and entrepreneurial fields.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the current direction of the University to lead in the local and global development through research, instruction, extension and production, and to produce competent graduates who can generate and extend leading technologies in multi-disciplinary areas beneficial to the community, this engagement of CPSU with Kansas State University is another noteworthy step closer to the realization of its goals.</p>
