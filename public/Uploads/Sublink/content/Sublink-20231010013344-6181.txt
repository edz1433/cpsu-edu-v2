This was exactly the reason why the Supreme Student Government(SSG), spearheaded by the federated president Hon. Carlo Boyayot and Vice President Andrelyn Bello, conducted the virtual Valentine program last Feb. 14, 2021 with the theme, "Healthy Heart Matters," during the regular weekend segment of the University in Radyo Bandera Sweet FM known as Abante CPSU: Edukasyon kag Impormasyon, hosted by its radio anchor, Dr. Flora Carpio, Director for Development Communication and Information of CPSU.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">“This was realized to make the Cenphilians feel the spirit of Valentine amidst pandemic,” said Ms. Bello.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">There are so many reasons to celebrate the occasion, the love and support of family, friends and the overflowing blessings and charity of the Almighty Creator, are few of the great things that Cenphilians should be thankful for, she added.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">Particularly, the event was to showcase the unique talents of Cenphilians in writing.
