Camanga, Brgy. Camingawan, Kabankalan City last September 13, 2021 at Mt. Ballo Hall, CPSU Main campus.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">As the University moves forward with technology fabrication and utilization, it becomes imperative to translate it to practical use by bringing these initiatives to the community level with life-changing impacts not only for the recipients’ socio-economic well-being, but for a greater cause such as forest and environment preservation and climate protection, to reciprocate the institution’s greening advocacies.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">Taking the leading role for technology innovation in the region, the said event was realized through the consistent support of the University president, Dr. Aladino Moraca. The DJ rocket stove is a sophisticated, improved design of the conventional cooking stove used by the community, which is proven easier and faster especially when making the fire with just few tinders and kindlings. Sustaining the fire also needs just few pieces of firewood compared with the traditional method, making it more efficient and beneficial. Its name, creatively thought to give the device its unique identity, are actually the initials of the hands behind the manual fabrication of the stove. They are Manong Danny and Manong Junior, hence, the name “DJ” rocket stove.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">Participated mostly by women representing each household, the design of this stove is especially advantageous for them and their children who are primarily assigned in this type of domestic chores of cooking and gathering firewood. Hence, having to save time intended for such work means being more productive since they could use it in performing other household tasks.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">Part of the said program was to share awareness to the participants on the preservation and conservation of their environment, and climate protection campaign, including organic farming through the green mining method as input for food security in this time of pandemic.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">Speakers were Forester Dominic Billen, Director for Environmental Management Services who spoke on the topic, “Preserving and Protecting Our Natural Resources,” and Sir Rhaprap Tondo, Farm Tech in-charge, on “Green Mining Teachnology,” both faculty members from the College of Agriculture and Forestry. In the afternoon, Engr. Rene Dagunan, Dean of the College of Engineering, discussed on the fabrication of the rocket stove and its efficiency compared with the traditional cooking stove.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">In his statement, Dr. Moraca highlighted on the significant global impact of this initiative to address many facets of social and economic dilemma in the community. As technology changes the landscape of how businesses run and how people function, innovations must also be felt in the community level especially for the marginal sectors to give them the chance to improve their quality of living.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">“This is a legacy technology that we share with our community especially those within our reservation area as a trade-off for them to seriously take part in conserving our forests, and protecting our environment through wise utilization of the available resources. Saving firewood for cooking means saving our trees. Also, less firewood means less carbon emission, thus, contributing to climate protection,” Dr. Moraca explained.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">Being founded on respect for the community and promotion of the University advocacies through technology generation leading towards transformed lives of farmer beneficiaries, this initiative realizes the University’s mantra which is to “Nurture, innovate and transform,” expanding focus from access to success.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">And since technology and culture directly influence each other, adopting this technology means a win-win solution to both the community and the institution as it redirects their traditional practices into a more environment and climate-friendly method of living. As it is said, flourishing environment creates a thriving community, and a thriving community makes a progressive country.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">The Prk. Camanga participants was headed by their prk. leader, Mrs. Gina Lumanog. Also present in the said event were Dr. Jimmy Degillo, the Director for Extension and Community Services Office, Dr. Merle Derrama, the OIC of the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS) and the program head of the Bachelor Arts (AB) in English Language, Prof. Mary Grace Noreen Leduna, program head of AB major in Social Science and the overall organizer of the event, Dr. Josephine Emoy, IMPDC director and the co-organizer of the program, Ms. Girlie Villanueva, the CAS extension coordinator, Engr. Rene Dagunan, Dean of the College of Engineering (COE), and Dr. Roland Marcel Bachiller, Dean of the College of Agriculture and Forestry (CAF), along with the other CAS, CAF and COE faculty members.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">By: J.A.
