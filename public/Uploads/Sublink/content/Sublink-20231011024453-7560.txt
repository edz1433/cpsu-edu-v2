Being close to the coastal community with fishing as the main source of livelihood for the locals, the CPSU Ilog Campus had been adamant in designing and generating practical and feasible technology to assist the fisherfolks in the area.</span></p><p><img src="https://cpsu.edu.ph/files/Arong-1.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><img src="https://cpsu.edu.ph/files/Arong-2.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;"><br></span></p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">This vision led to the recent launching of the "PROJECT ARONG," a practical, cost-effective and climate-suitable fish aggregating device with the objective to help the fisherfolks in Brgy. Bocana, Municipality of Ilog last August 4, 2021. This was realized in partnership with the Brgy. Bocana fisherfolks and the CPSU Ilog Campus headed by Mrs. Filipina Corpus, campus administrator, with the support and leadership of Dr. Aladino Moraca, CPSU president.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">The said design was conceptualized by the University Ilog campus, which was then shared to the fisherfolks who ardently adopted the design after seeing its viability and efficiency in increasing their regular catch to complement their conventional technique. During the said launching, five (5) sets were prepared by the locals and more are expected to be constructed in the weeks to come.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;"><img src="https://cpsu.edu.ph/files/Arong-3.jpg" style="width: 50%;"><img src="https://cpsu.edu.ph/files/Arong-4.jpg" style="width: 50%;"></p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">This is the University’s response to the international call for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) especially in extending technical assistance to small and marginal fisherfolks towards improving their quality of life.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">By: J.A.
