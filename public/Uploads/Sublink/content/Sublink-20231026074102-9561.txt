This was virtually attended by the CHED Chairperson and the Chair of the CPSU Board of Regents (BOR), Hon. J. Prospero E. De Vera, III, the Director General of PEZA, BGen Charito B. Plaza, the Regional Director of the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) in Region VI and a member of the CPSU BOR,&nbsp; &nbsp; Hon. Ro-Ann A.

Moraca, University President, Mrs. Jane T. Toledo, Records Officer, Dr. Merlindro Vargas, Director for Production and Enterprise Development, Dr. Marc Alexei Caesar Badajos, Vice-President for Finance and Administration, Dr. Fernando D.

With the plan’s emphasis of creating and developing CPSU as a “greenland city” through the establishment of economic zones like the tourism economic zone, agro-industrial economic zone, and I.T. parks and centers, among others, this will promise better employment opportunities to the local and neighboring communities, more revenues to the government in the form of taxes and will provide greater opportunities for local and foreign investments. Hence, this activity is one significant milestone that is worth remembering in the history and existence of CPSU,” Dr. Moraca stated.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;"><span style="font-family: Rubik;">These are some of the highlights in the vision of PEZA and CPSU which aims for the internationalization of exports-based investments, professionalization of the personnel of the economic zone administration and the proliferation of export literate workforce in Western Visayas.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;"><span style="font-family: Rubik;">In terms of the institution’s preparedness for this commitment, Dr. Moraca emphasized that the University’s current initiatives are geared for economic zone development of the province and the region. These include first, the flour industry development project in partnership with the Provincial Government of Negros Occidental and the local government unit of Kabankalan to maximize the underutilized root crops by the farmers; second, the production of safe and healthy food through organic farming practices in partnership with the farmers in its reservation area including other neighboring farmers and Indigenous People (IPs) in Negros Occidental and Oriental; third, development of practical and appropriate technologies, tools and equipment to support agricultural productivity. Some of these are the flour machine developed and perfected by the University R and D team, the development of the first tractor of the country in partnership with an international private sector, and its on-going project on essential oil production and processing. Fourth is the establishment of community-based and center-based education agri-eco tourism; and fifth is the production and processing of the natural muscovado sugar.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;"><span style="font-family: Rubik;">“These projects and programs will ensure food security and self-sustainability, creation of wealth at the local levels, more concrete livelihood activities and opportunities, and the development and adoption of life-changing technologies,” Dr. Moraca added.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;"><span style="font-family: Rubik;">Part of the program was the presentation of the Central Philippines State University Special Economic Zone Institute Council who will lead and manage the functions, duties and responsibilities of the team.
