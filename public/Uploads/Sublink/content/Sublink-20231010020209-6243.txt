Further, it aimed to enhance their knowledge and skills on soil health and nutrition, as well as proper soil management.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">With the insights they gained, they would then transfer this to the farmers in the six partner communities in Viet Nam specifically in improving their farm soil in order to sustain its productivity with the use of organic inputs.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;"><img src="https://cpsu.edu.ph/files/Internationalization - Maam Vic to Viet Nam-4.jpg" style="width: 828px;"></p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">This proves how CPSUâ€™s expertise have been recognized around the globe, and how its impact has reached far and wide with its advocacy of natural farming, conservation agriculture, environment protection, and sustainable livelihood to farmer communities.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">By J.A.
