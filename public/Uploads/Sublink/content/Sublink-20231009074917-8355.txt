The award that CPSU received is the fruit of the collaborative efforts of the Cenphilians. As we give quality services to our clienteles following the standards set by CHED and other accrediting agencies with clean and pure hearts, it is certain that we will receive rewards in heaven. Let us continue doing our share not only for the awards, but for a better CPSU,” Dr. Jungco stated.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">It could be noted that the University has already attained AACCUP level III accreditation in some of its degree programs like the BEED and BSED in the main campus, while the Bachelor in Sugar Technology (BST) and BS Statistics had just undergone evaluation for their level III status.
