Second is the open-systems agricultural machinery manufacturing on Regenerative Agriculture.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">“Simply, we will manufacture machines made in Negros industrializing the Negros countryside in partnership with RU foundry and machine shop (RUFMS).

We make our presence felt through the programs that we provide and extend to the community. We stand high and become proud of what our University is achieving right now. Whichever campus we are located, we become proud of bearing the name of CPSU,” Dr. Badajos emphasized.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">As CHED Commissioner J.
