<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">The University Presidents’ forum spearheaded by the Philippine Association of State Universities and Colleges (PASUC) and participated by the local and national SUCs in the country in collaboration with Taiwan Universities was organized for the purpose of increasing international engagement between the two countries, and establishing lifelong linkages in terms of research, instruction and extension exchange services.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">Held at the National University of Kaoshiung (NUK) in Taiwan, the said consortium held last July 5-9, 2019 was attended by 87 presidents and 12 vice-presidents from different universities and colleges in the Philippines and in Taiwan. Representing CPSU was Dr. Fernando D. Abello, the Vice-President for Academic Affairs. In the Opening Program, Dr. Ying-Yao Cheng, President of National Sun Yat-Sen University, welcomed everyone as he expressed his sincere appreciation and expectations for a strong partnership and future collaborations all in the name of quality education. Furthermore, Dr. S.L. Wang of NUK stated in his speech that this event was in response to the need of establishing socially and environmentally responsible higher education institutions (HEIs). Furthermore, it aimed to develop research innovation, partnership, benchmarking with other universities with cutting-edge technology and practices, and improvement of program offerings, as well as the mode of instruction.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">Future exchange programs between the two countries are therefore anticipated from this effort, since Mr. Wang emphasized in his speech their government’s concern in terms of shortage of student population because they had less enrollees yet their universities could accommodate large number of students, so they needed to invite more students to enroll in their universities. Part of the agenda that was given special attention in the said forum was on the new challenges and opportunities faced by the education sector, such as reforms in HEIs, globalization, sustainability, innovation, development of technology, community service and academic freedom.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">During the said five-day event, on-site visits to more than seven universities and agencies was also scheduled that showcased Taiwan’s state-of-the-art laboratory facilities, leading and innovative research and extension programs, including the country’s disaster management operation resiliency.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">In an interview on the significance and benefits of the said training to our institution, Dr. Abello, stated that this trip was truly gainful because it strengthened international partnership with the University. “This endeavor enables us to enhance and widen our visibility as a university to other universities in Asia and in the world. There must be inbound and outbound of faculty to harmonize global competitiveness considering that we should be one step forward in terms of research, instruction and extension innovation and practices,” &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dr. Abello added.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">The concrete proof that sealed this partnership was the Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) signing between the Wufeng University and the Philippine State Universities and Colleges that took place last August 12, 2019 at Negros Oriental State University, Main Campus I. With this, a brighter opportunity is opened for both students and faculty of CPSU in terms of future exchange programs in instruction, technology innovation, research and extension endeavors.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">By: J.A.
