With CPSU and DAR working side by side, this will expedite the process of extending life-changing programs and agricultural technologies in the countryside,” Dr. Moraca added.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px;">Signatories in the said MOA were Dr. Moraca, Dr. Paderes and PARCO 2 Arnulfo Figueroa.
