<p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">CPSU KABANKALAN CAMPUS - The Signing of the Memorandum of Agreement cum Turn-over Ceremony of the first-ever Philippine-made tractor with RU Foundry Machine Shop Corporation (RUFMSC) for Conservation Agriculture was held last September 15, 2021 at&nbsp; CPSU-Main Campus, Kabankalan City, Negros Occidental.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">The said event debuted with the presence of the University president Dr. Aladino Moraca and Sir Ramun Uy, the owner and CEO of RUFMSC, as a legacy technology of both agencies in concretizing their advocacy for regenerative farming with its international partner institution, the Kansas State University through Dr. Manuel “Manny” Reyes.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">Dr. Aladino Moraca, CPSU president, stated that this initiative aims to bring local actions with global impact as it strengthens sustainable agricultural mechanization not just in the country but even beyond.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">“With the fabrication of appropriate agricultural machineries for the promotion and intensification of organic farming, this endeavor is geared to provide socio-economic impacts that support climate change, food security, and poverty alleviation,” Dr. Moraca explained.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">“We respond to the challenge of the national government in terms of technology generation and innovation with viable outturn. Teamed with the right agencies, we deeply recognize the help and support of RU Foundry as a private sector in expediting the realization of this project. Also for Kansas State University through Dr. Manny Reyes for the zeal and inputs shared in coming up with this prototype design. We also have the support of the Eco Agri Foundation, Inc. with Sir Danny Moraca to lay down winning strategies to be implemented in the local level. No doubt,&nbsp; this project will be the pride of Negros and a legacy of CPSU to the entire country,” Dr. Moraca further said.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">Sir Uy likewise said that having CPSU to work with for a noble cause vivifies the&nbsp;true spirit of unity and “bayanihan”, especially&nbsp; in the midst of&nbsp;this crisis the country is facing.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">“It took us less than a year since the crafting of this plan to fabricate this model. We are able to channel the right assistance since Dr. Moraca knows what is really happening on the ground, and what the farmers need most so that appropriate support is given to them. Just like the assistance we extended with the farmer association initiated by the University, the CATAFA, in terms of machines and equipment they needed for the fabrication of their farm tools and implements. Now they have come a long way, serving as model to other farmer organizations,” Sir Uy said.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">The tractor’s unique design and features, completely assembled just this year (2021), is specifically constructed based on the concept of regenerative farming for Conservation Agriculture with sir Manny Reyes to ensure that there is minimum soil disturbance, thus, ensuring soil protection while enhancing soil health. This machine is considered environmentally-adaptable as it is built to grapple the type of geographical terrain in the region and the country, as a whole.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">Engr. Alfredo Castro, Jr., former dean of the College of Engineering who spoke on behalf of their incumbent dean, Engr. Dagunan, also stated that this partnership with RU foundry is a blessing to the University. Being a prototype model with its distinctive design, the tractor will be tested for possible future enhancements especially in terms of endurance. He ended his message highlighting on how change could be a great step for improvement, and how everyone should embrace it for a better version of the old.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">The tractor is expected to start operating the farm fields of the University in the next few days. With this output, it is expected to contribute in spurring rural industrialization in the countryside leading towards the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">Other Offices who collaborated for this project are the Research and Development Center headed by Dr. Angelie Rose Lumba, the College of Agriculture headed by their dean, Dr. Roland Marcel Bachiller, the College of Engineering with Engr. Dagunan and the Production Center.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">Also present to witness the said activity were the VP for Research and Extension Dr. Mae Flor Posadas, VP for Academic Affairs Dr. Fernando D. Abello, IMPDC director Dr. Josephine Asuncion Emoy, the faculty of the College of Engineering, personnel from the Research Unit and staff from RU Foundry.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">By:J.A.
