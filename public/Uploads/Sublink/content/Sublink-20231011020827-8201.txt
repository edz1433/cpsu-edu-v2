Each batch consisted of 25 participants who engaged in rigid hands-on training in organic agriculture production for 232 hours or equivalent to 29 days with classes from Mondays to Saturdays.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">The first two batches were beneficiaries of the Training for Work Scholarship Program or TWSP. Scholars in the first batch were farmers within CPSU community. Dr. Salvador Castor, Jr., former CAF dean, led in the organic agriculture training of this batch. Meanwhile, the participants for the second batch were the Indigenous People or IPs within Barangays Camingawan, Oringao and Tagukon. Their trainer was Sir Paul Doronila of CPSU Ilog Campus.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">The trainees not only learned innovative and practical skills in organic farming, but they also enjoyed the following scholarship benefits, training allowance, living allowance, provision of PPEs, training kits and internet allowance worth 500Php for the whole duration of the training, including life insurance.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">The third and fourth batches were under the Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education or UAQTE scholarship grant of TESDA. Recepients were senior high school graduates and college undergraduates with 10 years basic education but not college degree holders. Trainers were Sir Hansel Pedrosa of CPSU Hinigaran Campus for the third batch and Ma’am Mary Ann Cañada, CAF instructor in the Main Campus, for the fourth batch as assisted by CAF instructors. Each of the participants likewise received training allowance, living allowance, provision of PPEs, training kits, internet allowance worth 500Php for the whole duration of the training, including life insurance plus a check worth 5,000Php as book allowance.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">This training capacitated them to harness the livelihood skills they gained. With prudent and effecient use of this knowledge on the benefits of organic farming for food security, this could alleviate their present economic conditions and promise better life and future for them.</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Roboto Slab&quot;, serif;">By: J.A.
